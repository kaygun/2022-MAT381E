In the first\\nforty days a boy had been with him.  But after forty days without a\\nfish the boy\\'s parents had told him that the old man was now definitely\\nand finally _salao_, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy\\nhad gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish\\nthe first week.  It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each\\nday with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry\\neither the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was\\nfurled around the mast.  The sail was patched with flour sacks and,\\nfurled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat.\\n\\nThe old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his\\nneck.  The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings\\nfrom its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks.  The blotches\\nran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased\\nscars from handling heavy fish on the cords.  But none of these scars\\nwere fresh.  They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.\\n\\nEverything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same\\ncolor as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated.\\n\\n\"Santiago,\" the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the\\nskiff was hauled up.  \"I could go with you again.  We\\'ve made some\\nmoney.\"\\n\\nThe old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.\\n\\n\"No,\" the old man said.  \"You\\'re with a lucky boat.  Stay with them.\"\\n\\n\"But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we\\ncaught big ones every day for three weeks.\"\\n\\n\"I remember,\" the old man said.  \"I know you did not leave me because\\nyou doubted.\"\\n\\n\"It was papa made me leave.  I am a boy and I must obey him.\"\\n\\n\"I know,\" the old man said.  \"It is quite normal.\"\\n\\n\"He hasn\\'t much faith.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" the old man said.  \"But we have.  Haven\\'t we?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" the boy said.  \"Can I offer you a beer on the Terrace and then\\nwe\\'ll take the stuff home.\"\\n\\n\"Why not?\" the old man said.  \"Between fishermen.\"\\n\\nThey sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old\\nman and he was not angry.  Others, of the older fishermen, looked at\\nhim and were sad.  But they did not show it and they spoke politely\\nabout the current and the depths they had drifted their lines at and\\nthe steady good weather and of what they had seen.  The successful\\nfishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin\\nout and carried them laid full length across two planks, with two men\\nstaggering at the end of each plank, to the fish house where they\\nwaited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in Havana.  Those\\nwho had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other\\nside of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their\\nlivers removed, their fins cut off and their hides skinned out and\\ntheir flesh cut into strips for salting.\\n\\nWhen the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the\\nshark factory; but today there was only the faint edge of the odour\\nbecause the wind had backed into the north and then dropped off and it\\nwas pleasant and sunny on the Terrace.\\n\\n\"Santiago,\" the boy said.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" the old man said.  He was holding his glass and thinking of many\\nyears ago.\\n\\n\"Can I go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow?\"\\n\\n\"No.  Go and play baseball.  I can still row and Rogelio will throw the\\nnet.\"\\n\\n\"I would like to go.  If I cannot fish with you, I would like to serve\\nin some way.\"\\n\\n\"You bought me a beer,\" the old man said.  \"You are already a man.\"\\n\\n\"How old was I when you first took me in a boat?\"\\n\\n\"Five and you nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green\\nand he nearly tore the boat to pieces.  Can you remember?\"\\n\\n\"I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking\\nand the noise of the clubbing.  I can remember you throwing me into the\\nbow where the wet coiled lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver\\nand the noise of you clubbing him like chopping a tree down and the\\nsweet blood smell all over me.\"\\n\\n\"Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?\"\\n\\n\"I remember everything from when we first went together.\"\\n\\nThe old man looked at him with his sun-burned, confident loving eyes.\\n\\n\"If you were my boy I\\'d take you out and gamble,\" he said.  \"But you\\nare your father\\'s and your mother\\'s and you are in a lucky boat.\"\\n\\n\"May I get the sardines?  I know where I can get four baits too.\"\\n\\n\"I have mine left from today.  I put them in salt in the box.\"\\n\\n\"Let me get four fresh ones.\"\\n\\n\"One,\" the old man said.  His hope and his confidence had never gone.\\nBut now they were freshening as when the breeze rises.\\n\\n\"Two,\" the boy said.\\n\\n\"Two,\" the old man agreed.  \"You didn\\'t steal them?\"\\n\\n\"I would,\" the boy said.  \"But I bought these.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" the old man said.  He was too simple to wonder when he had\\nattained humility.  But he knew he had attained it and he knew it was\\nnot disgraceful and it carried no loss of true pride.\\n\\n\"Tomorrow is going to be a good day with this current,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Where are you going?\" the boy asked.\\n\\n\"Far out to come in when the wind shifts.  I want to be out before it\\nis light.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll try to get him to work far out,\" the boy said.  \"Then if you hook\\nsomething truly big we can come to your aid.\"\\n\\n\"He does not like to work too far out.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" the boy said.  \"But I will see something that he cannot see such\\nas a bird working and get him to come out after dolphin.\"\\n\\n\"Are his eyes that bad?\"\\n\\n\"He is almost blind.\"\\n\\n\"It is strange,\" the old man said.  \"He never went turtle-ing.  That is\\nwhat kills the eyes.\"\\n\\n\"But you went turtle-ing for years off the Mosquito Coast and your eyes\\nare good.\"\\n\\n\"I am a strange old man.\"\\n\\n\"But are you strong enough now for a truly big fish?\"\\n\\n\"I think so.  And there are many tricks.\"\\n\\n\"Let us take the stuff home,\" the boy said.  \"So I can get the cast net\\nand go after the sardines.\"\\n\\nThey picked up the gear from the boat.  The old man carried the mast on\\nhis shoulder and the boy carried the wooden box with the coiled,\\nhard-braided brown lines, the gaff and the harpoon with its shaft.  The\\nbox with the baits was under the stern of the skiff along with the club\\nthat was used to subdue the big fish when they were brought alongside.\\nNo one would steal from the old man but it was better to take the sail\\nand the heavy lines home as the dew was bad for them and, though he was\\nquite sure no local people would steal from him, the old man thought\\nthat a gaff and a harpoon were needless temptations to leave in a boat.\\n\\nThey walked up the road together to the old man\\'s shack and went in\\nthrough its open door.  The old man leaned the mast with its wrapped\\nsail against the wall and the boy put the box and the other gear beside\\nit.  The mast was nearly as long as the one room of the shack.  The\\nshack was made of the tough bud-shields of the royal palm which are\\ncalled _guano_ and in it there was a bed, a table, one chair, and a\\nplace on the dirt floor to cook with charcoal.  On the brown walls of\\nthe flattened, overlapping leaves of the sturdy fibered _guano_ there\\nwas a picture in color of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and another of the\\nVirgin of Cobre.  These were relics of his wife.  Once there had been a\\ntinted photograph of his wife on the wall but he had taken it down\\nbecause it made him too lonely to see it and it was on the shelf in the\\ncorner under his clean shirt.\\n\\n\"What do you have to eat?\" the boy asked.\\n\\n\"A pot of yellow rice with fish.  Do you want some?\"\\n\\n\"No.  I will eat at home.  Do you want me to make the fire?\"\\n\\n\"No.  I will make it later on.  Or I may eat the rice cold.\"\\n\\n\"May I take the cast net?\"\\n\\n\"Of course.\"\\n\\nThere was no cast net and the boy remembered when they had sold it.\\nBut they went through this fiction every day.  There was no pot of\\nyellow rice and fish and the boy knew this too.\\n\\n\"Eighty-five is a lucky number,\" the old man said.  \"How would you like\\nto see me bring one in that dressed out over a thousand pounds?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll get the cast net and go for sardines.  Will you sit in the sun in\\nthe doorway?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.  I have yesterday\\'s paper and I will read the baseball.\"\\n\\nThe boy did not know whether yesterday\\'s paper was a fiction too.  But\\nthe old man brought it out from under the bed.\\n\\n\"Perico gave it to me at the _bodega_,\" he explained.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll be back when I have the sardines.  I\\'ll keep yours and mine\\ntogether on ice and we can share them in the morning.  When I come back\\nyou can tell me about the baseball.\"\\n\\n\"The Yankees cannot lose.\"\\n\\n\"But I fear the Indians of Cleveland.\"\\n\\n\"Have faith in the Yankees my son.  Think of the great DiMaggio.\"\\n\\n\"I fear both the Tigers of Detroit and the Indians of Cleveland.\"\\n\\n\"Be careful or you will fear even the Reds of Cincinnati and the White\\nSox of Chicago.\"\\n\\n\"You study it and tell me when I come back.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think we should buy a terminal of the lottery with an\\neighty-five?  Tomorrow is the eighty-fifth day.\"\\n\\n\"We can do that,\" the boy said.  \"But what about the eighty-seven of\\nyour great record?\"\\n\\n\"It could not happen twice.  Do you think you can find an eighty-five?\"\\n\\n\"I can order one.\"\\n\\n\"One sheet.  That\\'s two dollars and a half.  Who can we borrow that\\nfrom?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s easy.  I can always borrow two dollars and a half.\"\\n\\n\"I think perhaps I can too.  But I try not to borrow.  First you\\nborrow.  Then you beg.\"\\n\\n\"Keep warm old man,\" the boy said.  \"Remember we are in September.\"\\n\\n\"The month when the great fish come,\" the old man said.  \"Anyone can be\\na fisherman in May.\"\\n\\n\"I go now for the sardines,\" the boy said.\\n\\nWhen the boy came back the old man was asleep in the chair and the sun\\nwas down.  The boy took the old army blanket off the bed and spread it\\nover the back of the chair and over the old man\\'s shoulders.  They were\\nstrange shoulders, still powerful although very old, and the neck was\\nstill strong too and the creases did not show so much when the old man\\nwas asleep and his head fallen forward.  His shirt had been patched so\\nmany times that it was like the sail and the patches were faded to many\\ndifferent shades by the sun.  The old man\\'s head was very old though\\nand with his eyes closed there was no life in his face.  The newspaper\\nlay across his knees and the weight of his arm held it there in the\\nevening breeze.  He was barefooted.\\n\\nThe boy left him there and when he came back the old man was still\\nasleep.\\n\\n\"Wake up old man,\" the boy said and put his hand on one of the old\\nman\\'s knees.\\n\\nThe old man opened his eyes and for a moment he was coming back from a\\nlong way away.  Then he smiled.\\n\\n\"What have you got?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Supper,\" said the boy.  \"We\\'re going to have supper.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not very hungry.\"\\n\\n\"Come on and eat.  You can\\'t fish and not eat.\"\\n\\n\"I have,\" the old man said getting up and taking the newspaper and\\nfolding it.  Then he started to fold the blanket.\\n\\n\"Keep the blanket around you,\" the boy said.  \"You\\'ll not fish without\\neating while I\\'m alive.\"\\n\\n\"Then live a long time and take care of yourself,\" the old man said.\\n\"What are we eating?\"\\n\\n\"Black beans and rice, fried bananas, and some stew.\"\\n\\nThe boy had brought them in a two-decker metal container from the\\nTerrace.  The two sets of knives and forks and spoons were in his\\npocket with a paper napkin wrapped around each set.\\n\\n\"Who gave this to you?\"\\n\\n\"Martin.  The owner.\"\\n\\n\"I must thank him.\"\\n\\n\"I thanked him already,\" the boy said.  \"You don\\'t need to thank him.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll give him the belly meat of a big fish,\" the old man said.  \"Has\\nhe done this for us more than once?\"\\n\\n\"I think so.\"\\n\\n\"I must give him something more than the belly meat then.  He is very\\nthoughtful for us.\"\\n\\n\"He sent two beers.\"\\n\\n\"I like the beer in cans best.\"\\n\\n\"I know.  But this is in bottles, Hatuey beer, and I take back the\\nbottles.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s very kind of you,\" the old man said.  \"Should we eat?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been asking you to,\" the boy told him gently.  \"I have not wished\\nto open the container until you were ready.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m ready now,\" the old man said.  \"I only needed time to wash.\"\\n\\nWhere did you wash? the boy thought.  The village water supply was two\\nstreets down the road.  I must have water here for him, the boy\\nthought, and soap and a good towel.  Why am I so thoughtless?  I must\\nget him another shirt and a jacket for the winter and some sort of\\nshoes and another blanket.\\n\\n\"Your stew is excellent,\" the old man said.\\n\\n\"Tell me about the baseball,\" the boy asked him.\\n\\n\"In the American League it is the Yankees as I said,\" the old man said\\nhappily.\\n\\n\"They lost today,\" the boy told him.\\n\\n\"That means nothing.  The great DiMaggio is himself again.\"\\n\\n\"They have other men on the team.\"\\n\\n\"Naturally.  But he makes the difference.  In the other league, between\\nBrooklyn and Philadelphia I must take Brooklyn.  But then I think of\\nDick Sisler and those great drives in the old park.\"\\n\\n\"There was nothing ever like them.  He hits the longest ball I have\\never seen.\"\\n\\n\"Do you remember when he used to come to the Terrace?  I wanted to take\\nhim fishing but I was too timid to ask him.  Then I asked you to ask\\nhim and you were too timid.\"\\n\\n\"I know.  It was a great mistake.  He might have gone with us.  Then we\\nwould have that for all of our lives.\"\\n\\n\"I would like to take the great DiMaggio fishing,\" the old man said.\\n\"They say his father was a fisherman.  Maybe he was as poor as we are\\nand would understand.\"\\n\\n\"The great Sisler\\'s father was never poor and he, the father, was\\nplaying in the big leagues when he was my age.\"\\n\\n\"When I was your age I was before the mast on a square rigged ship that\\nran to Africa and I have seen lions on the beaches in the evening.\"\\n\\n\"I know.  You told me.\"\\n\\n\"Should we talk about Africa or about baseball?\"\\n\\n\"Baseball I think,\" the boy said.  \"Tell me about the great John J.\\nMcGraw.\"  He said _Jota_ for J.\\n\\n\"He used to come to the Terrace sometimes too in the older days.  But\\nhe was rough and harsh-spoken and difficult when he was drinking.  His\\nmind was on horses as well as baseball.  At least he carried lists of\\nhorses at all times in his pocket and frequently spoke the names of\\nhorses on the telephone.\"\\n\\n\"He was a great manager,\" the boy said.  \"My father thinks he was the\\ngreatest.\"\\n\\n\"Because he came here the most times,\" the old man said.  \"If Durocher\\nhad continued to come here each year your father would think him the\\ngreatest manager.\"\\n\\n\"Who is the greatest manager, really, Luque or Mike Gonzalez?\"\\n\\n\"I think they are equal.\"\\n\\n\"And the best fisherman is you.\"\\n\\n\"No.  I know others better.\"\\n\\n\"_Qué va_,\" the boy said.  \"There are many good fishermen and some\\ngreat ones.  But there is only you.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you.  You make me happy.  I hope no fish will come along so\\ngreat that he will prove us wrong.\"\\n\\n\"There is no such fish if you are still strong as you say.\"\\n\\n\"I may not be as strong as I think,\" the old man said.  \"But I know\\nmany tricks and I have resolution.\"\\n\\n\"You ought to go to bed now so that you will be fresh in the morning.\\nI will take the things back to the Terrace.\"\\n\\n\"Good night then.  I will wake you in the morning.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re my alarm clock,\" the boy said.\\n\\n\"Age is my alarm clock,\" the old man said.  \"Why do old men wake so\\nearly?  Is it to have one longer day?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" the boy said.  \"All I know is that young boys sleep\\nlate and hard.\"\\n\\n\"I can remember it,\" the old man said.  \"I\\'ll waken you in time.\"\\n\\n\"I do not like for him to waken me.  It is as though I were inferior.\"\\n\\n\"I know.\"\\n\\n\"Sleep well, old man.\"\\n\\nThe boy went out.  They had eaten with no light on the table and the\\nold man took off his trousers and went to bed in the dark.  He rolled\\nhis trousers up to make a pillow, putting the newspaper inside them.\\nHe rolled himself in the blanket and slept on the other old newspapers\\nthat covered the springs of the bed.\\n\\nHe was asleep in a short time and he dreamed of Africa when he was a\\nboy and the long golden beaches and the white beaches, so white they\\nhurt your eyes, and the high capes and the great brown mountains.  He\\nlived along that coast now every night and in his dreams he heard the\\nsurf roar and saw the native boats come riding through it.  He smelled\\nthe tar and oakum of the deck as he slept and he smelled the smell of\\nAfrica that the land breeze brought at morning.\\n\\nUsually when he smelled the land breeze he woke up and dressed to go\\nand wake the boy.  But tonight the smell of the land breeze came very\\nearly and he knew it was too early in his dream and went on dreaming to\\nsee the white peaks of the Islands rising from the sea and then he\\ndreamed of the different harbours and roadsteads of the Canary Islands.\\n\\nHe no longer dreamed of storms, nor of women, nor of great occurrences,\\nnor of great fish, nor fights, nor contests of strength, nor of his\\nwife.  He only dreamed of places now and of the lions on the beach.\\nThey played like young cats in the dusk and he loved them as he loved\\nthe boy.  He never dreamed about the boy.  He simply woke, looked out\\nthe open door at the moon and unrolled his trousers and put them on.\\nHe urinated outside the shack and then went up the road to wake the\\nboy.  He was shivering with the morning cold.  But he knew he would\\nshiver himself warm and that soon he would be rowing.\\n\\nThe door of the house where the boy lived was unlocked and he opened it\\nand walked in quietly with his bare feet.  The boy was asleep on a cot\\nin the first room and the old man could see him clearly with the light\\nthat came in from the dying moon.  He took hold of one foot gently and\\nheld it until the boy woke and turned and looked at him.  The old man\\nnodded and the boy took his trousers from the chair by the bed and,\\nsitting on the bed, pulled them on.\\n\\nThe old man went out the door and the boy came after him.  He was\\nsleepy and the old man put his arm across his shoulders and said, \"I am\\nsorry.\"\\n\\n\"_Qué va_,\" the boy said.  \"It is what a man must do.\"\\n\\nThey walked down the road to the old man\\'s shack and all along the\\nroad, in the dark, barefoot men were moving, carrying the masts of\\ntheir boats.\\n\\nWhen they reached the old man\\'s shack the boy took the rolls of line in\\nthe basket and the harpoon and gaff and the old man carried the mast\\nwith the furled sail on his shoulder.\\n\\n\"Do you want coffee?\" the boy asked.\\n\\n\"We\\'ll put the gear in the boat and then get some.\"\\n\\nThey had coffee from condensed milk cans at an early morning place that\\nserved fishermen.\\n\\n\"How did you sleep old man?\" the boy asked.  He was waking up now\\nalthough it was still hard for him to leave his sleep.\\n\\n\"Very well, Manolin,\" the old man said.  \"I feel confident today.\"\\n\\n\"So do I,\" the boy said.  \"Now I must get your sardines and mine and\\nyour fresh baits.  He brings our gear himself.  He never wants anyone\\nto carry anything.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'re different,\" the old man said.  \"I let you carry things when you\\nwere five years old.\"\\n\\n\"I know it,\" the boy said.  \"I\\'ll be right back.  Have another coffee.\\nWe have credit here.\"\\n\\nHe walked off, bare-footed on the coral rocks, to the ice house where\\nthe baits were stored.\\n\\nThe old man drank his coffee slowly.  It was all he would have all day\\nand he knew that he should take it.  For a long time now eating had\\nbored him and he never carried a lunch.  He had a bottle of water in\\nthe bow of the skiff and that was all he needed for the day.\\n\\nThe boy was back now with the sardines and the two baits wrapped in a\\nnewspaper and they went down the trail to the skiff, feeling the\\npebbled sand under their feet, and lifted the skiff and slid her into\\nthe water.\\n\\n\"Good luck old man.\"\\n\\n\"Good luck,\" the old man said.  He fitted the rope lashings of the oars\\nonto the thole pins and, leaning forward against the thrust of the\\nblades in the water, he began to row out of the harbour in the dark.\\nThere were other boats from the other beaches going out to sea and the\\nold man heard the dip and push of their oars even though he could not\\nsee them now the moon was below the hills.\\n\\nSometimes someone would speak in a boat.  But most of the boats were\\nsilent except for the dip of the oars.  They spread apart after they\\nwere out of the mouth of the harbour and each one headed for the part\\nof the ocean where he hoped to find fish.  The old man knew he was\\ngoing far out and he left the smell of the land behind and rowed out\\ninto the clean early morning smell of the ocean.  He saw the\\nphosphorescence of the Gulf weed in the water as he rowed over the part\\nof the ocean that the fishermen called the great well because there was\\na sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms where all sorts of fish\\ncongregated because of the swirl the current made against the steep\\nwalls of the floor of the ocean.  Here there were concentrations of\\nshrimp and bait fish and sometimes schools of squid in the deepest\\nholes and these rose close to the surface at night where all the\\nwandering fish fed on them.\\n\\nIn the dark the old man could feel the morning coming and as he rowed\\nhe heard the trembling sound as flying fish left the water and the\\nhissing that their stiff set wings made as they soared away in the\\ndarkness.  He was very fond of flying fish as they were his principal\\nfriends on the ocean.  He was sorry for the birds, especially the small\\ndelicate dark terns that were always flying and looking and almost\\nnever finding, and he thought, \"The birds have a harder life than we do\\nexcept for the robber birds and the heavy strong ones.  Why did they\\nmake birds so delicate and fine as those sea swallows when the ocean\\ncan be so cruel?  She is kind and very beautiful.  But she can be so\\ncruel and it comes so suddenly and such birds that fly, dipping and\\nhunting, with their small sad voices are made too delicately for the\\nsea.\"\\n\\nHe always thought of the sea as _la mar_ which is what people call her\\nin Spanish when they love her.  Sometimes those who love her say bad\\nthings of her but they are always said as though she were a woman.\\nSome of the younger fishermen, those who used buoys as floats for their\\nlines and had motorboats, bought when the shark livers had brought much\\nmoney, spoke of her as _el mar_ which is masculine.  They spoke of her\\nas a contestant or a place or even an enemy.  But the old man always\\nthought of her as feminine and as something that gave or withheld great\\nfavours, and if she did wild or wicked things it was because she could\\nnot help them.  The moon affects her as it does a woman, he thought.\\n\\nHe was rowing steadily and it was no effort for him since he kept well\\nwithin his speed and the surface of the ocean was flat except for the\\noccasional swirls of the current.  He was letting the current do a\\nthird of the work and as it started to be light he saw he was already\\nfurther out than he had hoped to be at this hour.\\n\\nI worked the deep wells for a week and did nothing, he thought.  Today\\nI\\'ll work out where the schools of bonita and albacore are and maybe\\nthere will be a big one with them.\\n\\nBefore it was really light he had his baits out and was drifting with\\nthe current.  One bait was down forty fathoms.  The second was at\\nseventy-five and the third and fourth were down in the blue water at\\none hundred and one hundred and twenty-five fathoms.  Each bait hung\\nhead down with the shank of the hook inside the bait fish, tied and\\nsewed solid and all the projecting part of the hook, the curve and the\\npoint, was covered with fresh sardines.  Each sardine was hooked\\nthrough both eyes so that they made a half-garland on the projecting\\nsteel.  There was no part of the hook that a great fish could feel\\nwhich was not sweet smelling and good tasting.\\n\\nThe boy had given him two fresh small tunas, or albacores, which hung\\non the two deepest lines like plummets and, on the others, he had a big\\nblue runner and a yellow jack that had been used before; but they were\\nin good condition still and had the excellent sardines to give them\\nscent and attractiveness.  Each line, as thick around as a big pencil,\\nwas looped onto a green-sapped stick so that any pull or touch on the\\nbait would make the stick dip and each line had two forty-fathom coils\\nwhich could be made fast to the other spare coils so that, if it were\\nnecessary, a fish could take out over three hundred fathoms of line.\\n\\nNow the man watched the dip of the three sticks over the side of the\\nskiff and rowed gently to keep the lines straight up and down and at\\ntheir proper depths.  It was quite light and any moment now the sun\\nwould rise.\\n\\nThe sun rose thinly from the sea and the old man could see the other\\nboats, low on the water and well in toward the shore, spread out across\\nthe current.  Then the sun was brighter and the glare came on the water\\nand then, as it rose clear, the flat sea sent it back at his eyes so\\nthat it hurt sharply and he rowed without looking into it.  He looked\\ndown into the water and watched the lines that went straight down into\\nthe dark of the water.  He kept them straighter than anyone did, so\\nthat at each level in the darkness of the stream there would be a bait\\nwaiting exactly where he wished it to be for any fish that swam there.\\nOthers let them drift with the current and sometimes they were at sixty\\nfathoms when the fishermen thought they were at a hundred.\\n\\nBut, he thought, I keep them with precision.  Only I have no luck any\\nmore.  But who knows?  Maybe today.  Every day is a new day.  It is\\nbetter to be lucky.  But I would rather be exact.  Then when luck comes\\nyou are ready.\\n\\nThe sun was two hours higher now and it did not hurt his eyes so much\\nto look into the east.  There were only three boats in sight now and\\nthey showed very low and far inshore.\\n\\nAll my life the early sun has hurt my eyes, he thought.  Yet they are\\nstill good.  In the evening I can look straight into it without getting\\nthe blackness.  It has more force in the evening too.  But in the\\nmorning it is painful.\\n\\nJust then he saw a man-of-war bird with his long black wings circling\\nin the sky ahead of him.  He made a quick drop, slanting down on his\\nback-swept wings, and then circled again.\\n\\n\"He\\'s got something,\" the old man said aloud.  \"He\\'s not just looking.\"\\n\\nHe rowed slowly and steadily toward where the bird was circling.  He\\ndid not hurry and he kept his lines straight up and down.  But he\\ncrowded the current a little so that he was still fishing correctly\\nthough faster than he would have fished if he was not trying to use the\\nbird.\\n\\nThe bird went higher in the air and circled again, his wings\\nmotionless.  Then he dove suddenly and the old man saw flying fish\\nspurt out of the water and sail desperately over the surface.\\n\\n\"Dolphin,\" the old man said aloud.  \"Big dolphin.\"\\n\\nHe shipped his oars and brought a small line from under the bow.  It\\nhad a wire leader and a medium-sized hook and he baited it with one of\\nthe sardines.  He let it go over the side and then made it fast to a\\nring bolt in the stern.  Then he baited another line and left it coiled\\nin the shade of the bow.  He went back to rowing and to watching the\\nlong-winged black bird who was working, now, low over the water.\\n\\nAs he watched the bird dipped again slanting his wings for the dive and\\nthen swinging them wildly and ineffectually as he followed the flying\\nfish.  The old man could see the slight bulge in the water that the big\\ndolphin raised as they followed the escaping fish.  The dolphin were\\ncutting through the water below the flight of the fish and would be in\\nthe water, driving at speed, when the fish dropped.  It is a big school\\nof dolphin, he thought.  They are wide spread and the flying fish have\\nlittle chance.  The bird has no chance.  The flying fish are too big\\nfor him and they go too fast.\\n\\nHe watched the flying fish burst out again and again and the\\nineffectual movements of the bird.  That school has gotten away from\\nme, he thought.  They are moving out too fast and too far.  But perhaps\\nI will pick up a stray and perhaps my big fish is around them.  My big\\nfish must be somewhere.\\n\\nThe clouds over the land now rose like mountains and the coast was only\\na long green line with the gray blue hills behind it.  The water was a\\ndark blue now, so dark that it was almost purple.  As he looked down\\ninto it he saw the red sifting of the plankton in the dark water and\\nthe strange light the sun made now.  He watched his lines to see them\\ngo straight down out of sight into the water and he was happy to see so\\nmuch plankton because it meant fish.  The strange light the sun made in\\nthe water, now that the sun was higher, meant good weather and so did\\nthe shape of the clouds over the land.  But the bird was almost out of\\nsight now and nothing showed on the surface of the water but some\\npatches of yellow, sun-bleached Sargasso weed and the purple,\\nformalized, iridescent, gelatinous bladder of a Portuguese man-of-war\\nfloating close beside the boat.  It turned on its side and then righted\\nitself.  It floated cheerfully as a bubble with its long deadly purple\\nfilaments trailing a yard behind it in the water.\\n\\n\"_Agua mala_,\" the man said.  \"You whore.\"\\n\\nFrom where he swung lightly against his oars he looked down into the\\nwater and saw the tiny fish that were coloured like the trailing\\nfilaments and swam between them and under the small shade the bubble\\nmade as it drifted.  They were immune to its poison.  But men were not\\nand when some of the filaments would catch on a line and rest there\\nslimy and purple while the old man was working a fish, he would have\\nwelts and sores on his arms and hands of the sort that poison ivy or\\npoison oak can give.  But these poisonings from the _agua mala_ came\\nquickly and struck like a whiplash.\\n\\nThe iridescent bubbles were beautiful.  But they were the falsest thing\\nin the sea and the old man loved to see the big sea turtles eating\\nthem.  The turtles saw them, approached them from the front, then shut\\ntheir eyes so they were completely carapaced and ate them filaments and\\nall.  The old man loved to see the turtles eat them and he loved to\\nwalk on them on the beach after a storm and hear them pop when he\\nstepped on them with the horny soles of his feet.\\n\\nHe loved green turtles and hawks-bills with their elegance and speed\\nand their great value and he had a friendly contempt for the huge,\\nstupid loggerheads, yellow in their armour-plating, strange in their\\nlove-making, and happily eating the Portuguese men-of-war with their\\neyes shut.\\n\\nHe had no mysticism about turtles although he had gone in turtle boats\\nfor many years.  He was sorry for them all, even the great trunk backs\\nthat were as long as the skiff and weighed a ton.  Most people are\\nheartless about turtles because a turtle\\'s heart will beat for hours\\nafter he has been cut up and butchered.  But the old man thought, I\\nhave such a heart too and my feet and hands are like theirs.  He ate\\nthe white eggs to give himself strength.  He ate them all through May\\nto be strong in September and October for the truly big fish.\\n\\nHe also drank a cup of shark liver oil each day from the big drum in\\nthe shack where many of the fishermen kept their gear.  It was there\\nfor all fishermen who wanted it.  Most fishermen hated the taste.  But\\nit was no worse than getting up at the hours that they rose and it was\\nvery good against all colds and grippes and it was good for the eyes.\\n\\nNow the old man looked up and saw that the bird was circling again.\\n\\n\"He\\'s found fish,\" he said aloud.  No flying fish broke the surface and\\nthere was no scattering of bait fish.  But as the old man watched, a\\nsmall tuna rose in the air, turned and dropped head first into the\\nwater.  The tuna shone silver in the sun and after he had dropped back\\ninto the water another and another rose and they were jumping in all\\ndirections, churning the water and leaping in long jumps after the\\nbait.  They were circling it and driving it.\\n\\nIf they don\\'t travel too fast I will get into them, the old man\\nthought, and he watched the school working the water white and the bird\\nnow dropping and dipping into the bait fish that were forced to the\\nsurface in their panic.\\n\\n\"The bird is a great help,\" the old man said.  Just then the stern line\\ncame taut under his foot, where he had kept a loop of the line, and he\\ndropped his oars and felt the weight of the small tuna\\'s shivering pull\\nas he held the line firm and commenced to haul it in.  The shivering\\nincreased as he pulled in and he could see the blue back of the fish in\\nthe water and the gold of his sides before he swung him over the side\\nand into the boat.  He lay in the stern in the sun, compact and bullet\\nshaped, his big, unintelligent eyes staring as he thumped his life out\\nagainst the planking of the boat with the quick shivering strokes of\\nhis neat, fast-moving tail.  The old man hit him on the head for\\nkindness and kicked him, his body still shuddering, under the shade of\\nthe stern.\\n\\n\"Albacore,\" he said aloud.  \"He\\'ll make a beautiful bait.  He\\'ll weigh\\nten pounds.\"\\n\\nHe did not remember when he had first started to talk aloud when he was\\nby himself.  He had sung when he was by himself in the old days and he\\nhad sung at night sometimes when he was alone steering on his watch in\\nthe smacks or in the turtle boats.  He had probably started to talk\\naloud, when alone, when the boy had left.  But he did not remember.\\nWhen he and the boy fished together they usually spoke only when it was\\nnecessary.  They talked at night or when they were storm-bound by bad\\nweather.  It was considered a virtue not to talk unnecessarily at sea\\nand the old man had always considered it so and respected it.  But now\\nhe said his thoughts aloud many times since there was no one that they\\ncould annoy.\\n\\n\"If the others heard me talking out loud they would think that I am\\ncrazy,\" he said aloud.  \"But since I am not crazy, I do not care.  And\\nthe rich have radios to talk to them in their boats and to bring them\\nthe baseball.\"\\n\\nNow is no time to think of baseball, he thought.  Now is the time to\\nthink of only one thing.  That which I was born for.  There might be a\\nbig one around that school, he thought.  I picked up only a straggler\\nfrom the albacore that were feeding.  But they are working far out and\\nfast.  Everything that shows on the surface today travels very fast and\\nto the north-east.  Can that be the time of day?  Or is it some sign of\\nweather that I do not know?\\n\\nHe could not see the green of the shore now but only the tops of the\\nblue hills that showed white as though they were snow-capped and the\\nclouds that looked like high snow mountains above them.  The sea was\\nvery dark and the light made prisms in the water.  The myriad flecks of\\nthe plankton were annulled now by the high sun and it was only the\\ngreat deep prisms in the blue water that the old man saw now with his\\nlines going straight down into the water that was a mile deep.\\n\\nThe tuna, the fishermen called all the fish of that species tuna and\\nonly distinguished among them by their proper names when they came to\\nsell them or to trade them for baits, were down again.  The sun was hot\\nnow and the old man felt it on the back of his neck and felt the sweat\\ntrickle down his back as he rowed.\\n\\nI could just drift, he thought, and sleep and put a bight of line\\naround my toe to wake me.  But today is eighty-five days and I should\\nfish the day well.\\n\\nJust then, watching his lines, he saw one of the projecting green\\nsticks dip sharply.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he said.  \"Yes,\" and shipped his oars without bumping the boat.\\nHe reached out for the line and held it softly between the thumb and\\nforefinger of his right hand.  He felt no strain nor weight and he held\\nthe line lightly.  Then it came again.  This time it was a tentative\\npull, not solid nor heavy, and he knew exactly what it was.  One\\nhundred fathoms down a marlin was eating the sardines that covered the\\npoint and the shank of the hook where the hand-forged hook projected\\nfrom the head of the small tuna.\\n\\nThe old man held the line delicately, and softly, with his left hand,\\nunleashed it from the stick.  Now he could let it run through his\\nfingers without the fish feeling any tension.\\n\\nThis far out, he must be huge in this month, he thought.  Eat them,\\nfish.  Eat them.  Please eat them.  How fresh they are and you down\\nthere six hundred feet in that cold water in the dark.  Make another\\nturn in the dark and come back and eat them.\\n\\nHe felt the light delicate pulling and then a harder pull when a\\nsardine\\'s head must have been more difficult to break from the hook.\\nThen there was nothing.\\n\\n\"Come on,\" the old man said aloud.  \"Make another turn.  Just smell\\nthem.  Aren\\'t they lovely?  Eat them good now and then there is the\\ntuna.  Hard and cold and lovely.  Don\\'t be shy, fish.  Eat them.\"\\n\\nHe waited with the line between his thumb and his finger, watching it\\nand the other lines at the same time for the fish might have swum up or\\ndown.  Then came the same delicate pulling touch again.\\n\\n\"He\\'ll take it,\" the old man said aloud.  \"God help him to take it.\"\\n\\nHe did not take it though.  He was gone and the old man felt nothing.\\n\\n\"He can\\'t have gone,\" he said.  \"Christ knows he can\\'t have gone.  He\\'s\\nmaking a turn.  Maybe he has been hooked before and he remembers\\nsomething of it.\"\\n\\nThen he felt the gentle touch on the line and he was happy.\\n\\n\"It was only his turn,\" he said.  \"He\\'ll take it.\"\\n\\nHe was happy feeling the gentle pulling and then he felt something hard\\nand unbelievably heavy.  It was the weight of the fish and he let the\\nline slip down, down, down, unrolling off the first of the two reserve\\ncoils.  As it went down, slipping lightly through the old man\\'s\\nfingers, he still could feel the great weight, though the pressure of\\nhis thumb and finger were almost imperceptible.\\n\\n\"What a fish,\" he said.  \"He has it sideways in his mouth now and he is\\nmoving off with it.\"\\n\\nThen he will turn and swallow it, he thought.  He did not say that\\nbecause he knew that if you said a good thing it might not happen.  He\\nknew what a huge fish this was and he thought of him moving away in the\\ndarkness with the tuna held crosswise in his mouth.  At that moment he\\nfelt him stop moving but the weight was still there.  Then the weight\\nincreased and he gave more line.  He tightened the pressure of his\\nthumb and finger for a moment and the weight increased and was going\\nstraight down.\\n\\n\"He\\'s taken it,\" he said.  \"Now I\\'ll let him eat it well.\"\\n\\nHe let the line slip through his fingers while he reached down with his\\nleft hand and made fast the free end of the two reserve coils to the\\nloop of the two reserve coils of the next line.  Now he was ready.  He\\nhad three forty-fathom coils of line in reserve now, as well as the\\ncoil he was using.\\n\\n\"Eat it a little more,\" he said.  \"Eat it well.\"\\n\\nEat it so that the point of the hook goes into your heart and kills\\nyou, he thought.  Come up easy and let me put the harpoon into you.\\nAll right.  Are you ready?  Have you been long enough at table?\\n\\n\"Now!\" he said aloud and struck hard with both hands, gained a yard of\\nline and then struck again and again, swinging with each arm\\nalternately on the cord with all the strength of his arms and the\\npivoted weight of his body.\\n\\nNothing happened.  The fish just moved away slowly and the old man\\ncould not raise him an inch.  His line was strong and made for heavy\\nfish and he held it against his back until it was so taut that beads of\\nwater were jumping from it.  Then it began to make a slow hissing sound\\nin the water and he still held it, bracing himself against the thwart\\nand leaning back against the pull.  The boat began to move slowly off\\ntoward the North-West.\\n\\nThe fish moved steadily and they travelled slowly on the calm water.\\nThe other baits were still in the water but there was nothing to be\\ndone.\\n\\n\"I wish I had the boy,\" the old man said aloud.  \"I\\'m being towed by a\\nfish and I\\'m the towing bitt.  I could make the line fast.  But then he\\ncould break it.  I must hold him all I can and give him line when he\\nmust have it.  Thank God he is travelling and not going down.\"\\n\\nWhat I will do if he decides to go down, I don\\'t know.  What I\\'ll do if\\nhe sounds and dies I don\\'t know.  But I\\'ll do something.  There are\\nplenty of things I can do.\\n\\nHe held the line against his back and watched its slant in the water\\nand the skiff moving steadily to the North-West.\\n\\nThis will kill him, the old man thought.  He can\\'t do this forever.\\nBut four hours later the fish was still swimming steadily out to sea,\\ntowing the skiff, and the old man was still braced solidly with the\\nline across his back.\\n\\n\"It was noon when I hooked him,\" he said.  \"And I have never seen him.\"\\n\\nHe had pushed his straw hat hard down on his head before he hooked the\\nfish and it was cutting his forehead.  He was thirsty too and he got\\ndown on his knees and, being careful not to jerk on the line, moved as\\nfar into the bow as he could get and reached the water bottle with one\\nhand.  He opened it and drank a little.  Then he rested against the\\nbow.  He rested sitting on the un-stepped mast and sail and tried not\\nto think but only to endure.\\n\\nThen he looked behind him and saw that no land was visible.  That makes\\nno difference, he thought.  I can always come in on the glow from\\nHavana.  There are two more hours before the sun sets and maybe he will\\ncome up before that.  If he doesn\\'t maybe he will come up with the\\nmoon.  If he does not do that maybe he will come up with the sunrise.\\nI have no cramps and I feel strong.  It is he that has the hook in his\\nmouth.  But what a fish to pull like that.  He must have his mouth shut\\ntight on the wire.  I wish I could see him.  I wish I could see him\\nonly once to know what I have against me.\\n\\nThe fish never changed his course nor his direction all that night as\\nfar as the man could tell from watching the stars.  It was cold after\\nthe sun went down and the old man\\'s sweat dried cold on his back and\\nhis arms and his old legs.  During the day he had taken the sack that\\ncovered the bait box and spread it in the sun to dry.  After the sun\\nwent down he tied it around his neck so that it hung down over his back\\nand he cautiously worked it down under the line that was across his\\nshoulders now.  The sack cushioned the line and he had found a way of\\nleaning forward against the bow so that he was almost comfortable.  The\\nposition actually was only somewhat less intolerable; but he thought of\\nit as almost comfortable.\\n\\nI can do nothing with him and he can do nothing with me, he thought.\\nNot as long as he keeps this up.\\n\\nOnce he stood up and urinated over the side of the skiff and looked at\\nthe stars and checked his course.  The line showed like a\\nphosphorescent streak in the water straight out from his shoulders.\\nThey were moving more slowly now and the glow of Havana was not so\\nstrong, so that he knew the current must be carrying them to the\\neastward.  If I lose the glare of Havana we must be going more to the\\neastward, he thought.  For if the fish\\'s course held true I must see it\\nfor many more hours.  I wonder how the baseball came out in the grand\\nleagues today, he thought.  It would be wonderful to do this with a\\nradio.  Then he thought, think of it always.  Think of what you are\\ndoing.  You must do nothing stupid.\\n\\nThen he said aloud, \"I wish I had the boy.  To help me and to see this.\"\\n\\nNo one should be alone in their old age, he thought.  But it is\\nunavoidable.  I must remember to eat the tuna before he spoils in order\\nto keep strong.  Remember, no matter how little you want to, that you\\nmust eat him in the morning.  Remember, he said to himself.\\n\\nDuring the night two porpoise came around the boat and he could hear\\nthem rolling and blowing.  He could tell the difference between the\\nblowing noise the male made and the sighing blow of the female.\\n\\n\"They are good,\" he said.  \"They play and make jokes and love one\\nanother.  They are our brothers like the flying fish.\"\\n\\nThen he began to pity the great fish that he had hooked.  He is\\nwonderful and strange and who knows how old he is, he thought.  Never\\nhave I had such a strong fish nor one who acted so strangely.  Perhaps\\nhe is too wise to jump.  He could ruin me by jumping or by a wild rush.\\nBut perhaps he has been hooked many times before and he knows that this\\nis how he should make his fight.  He cannot know that it is only one\\nman against him, nor that it is an old man.  But what a great fish he\\nis and what he will bring in the market if the flesh is good.  He took\\nthe bait like a male and he pulls like a male and his fight has no\\npanic in it.  I wonder if he has any plans or if he is just as\\ndesperate as I am?\\n\\nHe remembered the time he had hooked one of a pair of marlin.  The male\\nfish always let the female fish feed first and the hooked fish, the\\nfemale, made a wild, panic-stricken, despairing fight that soon\\nexhausted her, and all the time the male had stayed with her, crossing\\nthe line and circling with her on the surface.  He had stayed so close\\nthat the old man was afraid he would cut the line with his tail which\\nwas sharp as a scythe and almost of that size and shape.  When the old\\nman had gaffed her and clubbed her, holding the rapier bill with its\\nsandpaper edge and clubbing her across the top of her head until her\\ncolour turned to a colour almost like the backing of mirrors, and then,\\nwith the boy\\'s aid, hoisted her aboard, the male fish had stayed by the\\nside of the boat.  Then, while the old man was clearing the lines and\\npreparing the harpoon, the male fish jumped high into the air beside\\nthe boat to see where the female was and then went down deep, his\\nlavender wings, that were his pectoral fins, spread wide and all his\\nwide lavender stripes showing.  He was beautiful, the old man\\nremembered, and he had stayed.\\n\\nThat was the saddest thing I ever saw with them, the old man thought.\\nThe boy was sad too and we begged her pardon and butchered her promptly.\\n\\n\"I wish the boy was here,\" he said aloud and settled himself against\\nthe rounded planks of the bow and felt the strength of the great fish\\nthrough the line he held across his shoulders moving steadily toward\\nwhatever he had chosen.\\n\\nWhen once, through my treachery, it had been necessary to him to make a\\nchoice, the old man thought.\\n\\nHis choice had been to stay in the deep dark water far out beyond all\\nsnares and traps and treacheries.  My choice was to go there to find\\nhim beyond all people.  Beyond all people in the world.  Now we are\\njoined together and have been since noon.  And no one to help either\\none of us.\\n\\nPerhaps I should not have been a fisherman, he thought.  But that was\\nthe thing that I was born for.  I must surely remember to eat the tuna\\nafter it gets light.\\n\\nSome time before daylight something took one of the baits that were\\nbehind him.  He heard the stick break and the line begin to rush out\\nover the gunwale of the skiff.  In the darkness he loosened his sheath\\nknife and taking all the strain of the fish on his left shoulder he\\nleaned back and cut the line against the wood of the gunwale.  Then he\\ncut the other line closest to him and in the dark made the loose ends\\nof the reserve coils fast.  He worked skillfully with the one hand and\\nput his foot on the coils to hold them as he drew his knots tight.  Now\\nhe had six reserve coils of line.  There were two from each bait he had\\nsevered and the two from the bait the fish had taken and they were all\\nconnected.\\n\\nAfter it is light, he thought, I will work back to the forty-fathom\\nbait and cut it away too and link up the reserve coils.  I will have\\nlost two hundred fathoms of good Catalan _cordel_ and the hooks and\\nleaders.  That can be replaced.  But who replaces this fish if I hook\\nsome fish and it cuts him off?  I don\\'t know what that fish was that\\ntook the bait just now.  It could have been a marlin or a broadbill or\\na shark.  I never felt him.  I had to get rid of him too fast.\\n\\nAloud he said, \"I wish I had the boy.\"\\n\\nBut you haven\\'t got the boy, he thought.  You have only yourself and\\nyou had better work back to the last line now, in the dark or not in\\nthe dark, and cut it away and hook up the two reserve coils.\\n\\nSo he did it.  It was difficult in the dark and once the fish made a\\nsurge that pulled him down on his face and made a cut below his eye.\\nThe blood ran down his cheek a little way.  But it coagulated and dried\\nbefore it reached his chin and he worked his way back to the bow and\\nrested against the wood.  He adjusted the sack and carefully worked the\\nline so that it came across a new part of his shoulders and, holding it\\nanchored with his shoulders, he carefully felt the pull of the fish and\\nthen felt with his hand the progress of the skiff through the water.\\n\\nI wonder what he made that lurch for, he thought.  The wire must have\\nslipped on the great hill of his back.  Certainly his back cannot feel\\nas badly as mine does.  But he cannot pull this skiff forever, no\\nmatter how great he is.  Now everything is cleared away that might make\\ntrouble and I have a big reserve of line; all that a man can ask.\\n\\n\"Fish,\" he said softly, aloud, \"I\\'ll stay with you until I am dead.\"\\n\\nHe\\'ll stay with me too, I suppose, the old man thought and he waited\\nfor it to be light.  It was cold now in the time before daylight and he\\npushed against the wood to be warm.  I can do it as long as he can, he\\nthought.  And in the first light the line extended out and down into\\nthe water.  The boat moved steadily and when the first edge of the sun\\nrose it was on the old man\\'s right shoulder.\\n\\n\"He\\'s headed north,\" the old man said.  The current will have set us\\nfar to the eastward, he thought.  I wish he would turn with the\\ncurrent.  That would show that he was tiring.\\n\\nWhen the sun had risen further the old man realized that the fish was\\nnot tiring.  There was only one favorable sign.  The slant of the line\\nshowed he was swimming at a lesser depth.  That did not necessarily\\nmean that he would jump.  But he might.\\n\\n\"God let him jump,\" the old man said.  \"I have enough line to handle\\nhim.\"\\n\\nMaybe if I can increase the tension just a little it will hurt him and\\nhe will jump, he thought.  Now that it is daylight let him jump so that\\nhe\\'ll fill the sacks along his backbone with air and then he cannot go\\ndeep to die.\\n\\nHe tried to increase the tension, but the line had been taut up to the\\nvery edge of the breaking point since he had hooked the fish and he\\nfelt the harshness as he leaned back to pull and knew he could put no\\nmore strain on it.  I must not jerk it ever, he thought.  Each jerk\\nwidens the cut the hook makes and then when he does jump he might throw\\nit.  Anyway I feel better with the sun and for once I do not have to\\nlook into it.\\n\\nThere was yellow weed on the line but the old man knew that only made\\nan added drag and he was pleased.  It was the yellow Gulf weed that had\\nmade so much phosphorescence in the night.\\n\\n\"Fish,\" he said, \"I love you and respect you very much.  But I will\\nkill you dead before this day ends.\"\\n\\nLet us hope so, he thought.\\n\\nA small bird came toward the skiff from the north.  He was a warbler\\nand flying very low over the water.  The old man could see that he was\\nvery tired.\\n\\nThe bird made the stern of the boat and rested there.  Then he flew\\naround the old man\\'s head and rested on the line where he was more\\ncomfortable.\\n\\n\"How old are you?\" the old man asked the bird.  \"Is this your first\\ntrip?\"\\n\\nThe bird looked at him when he spoke.  He was too tired even to examine\\nthe line and he teetered on it as his delicate feet gripped it fast.\\n\\n\"It\\'s steady,\" the old man told him.  \"It\\'s too steady.  You shouldn\\'t\\nbe that tired after a windless night.  What are birds coming to?\"\\n\\nThe hawks, he thought, that come out to sea to meet them.  But he said\\nnothing of this to the bird who could not understand him anyway and who\\nwould learn about the hawks soon enough.\\n\\n\"Take a good rest, small bird,\" he said.  \"Then go in and take your\\nchance like any man or bird or fish.\"\\n\\nIt encouraged him to talk because his back had stiffened in the night\\nand it hurt truly now.\\n\\n\"Stay at my house if you like, bird,\" he said.  \"I am sorry I cannot\\nhoist the sail and take you in with the small breeze that is rising.\\nBut I am with a friend.\"\\n\\nJust then the fish gave a sudden lurch that pulled the old man down\\nonto the bow and would have pulled him overboard if he had not braced\\nhimself and given some line.\\n\\nThe bird had flown up when the line jerked and the old man had not even\\nseen him go.  He felt the line carefully with his right hand and\\nnoticed his hand was bleeding.\\n\\n\"Something hurt him then,\" he said aloud and pulled back on the line to\\nsee if he could turn the fish.  But when he was touching the breaking\\npoint he held steady and settled back against the strain of the line.\\n\\n\"You\\'re feeling it now, fish,\" he said.  \"And so, God knows, am I.\"\\n\\nHe looked around for the bird now because he would have liked him for\\ncompany.  The bird was gone.\\n\\nYou did not stay long, the man thought.  But it is rougher where you\\nare going until you make the shore.  How did I let the fish cut me with\\nthat one quick pull he made?  I must be getting very stupid.  Or\\nperhaps I was looking at the small bird and thinking of him.  Now I\\nwill pay attention to my work and then I must eat the tuna so that I\\nwill not have a failure of strength.\\n\\n\"I wish the boy were here and that I had some salt,\" he said aloud.\\n\\nShifting the weight of the line to his left shoulder and kneeling\\ncarefully he washed his hand in the ocean and held it there, submerged,\\nfor more than a minute watching the blood trail away and the steady\\nmovement of the water against his hand as the boat moved.\\n\\n\"He has slowed much,\" he said.\\n\\nThe old man would have liked to keep his hand in the salt water longer\\nbut he was afraid of another sudden lurch by the fish and he stood up\\nand braced himself and held his hand up against the sun.  It was only a\\nline burn that had cut his flesh.  But it was in the working part of\\nhis hand.  He knew he would need his hands before this was over and he\\ndid not like to be cut before it started.\\n\\n\"Now,\" he said, when his hand had dried, \"I must eat the small tuna.  I\\ncan reach him with the gaff and eat him here in comfort.\"\\n\\nHe knelt down and found the tuna under the stern with the gaff and drew\\nit toward him keeping it clear of the coiled lines.  Holding the line\\nwith his left shoulder again, and bracing on his left hand and arm, he\\ntook the tuna off the gaff hook and put the gaff back in place.  He put\\none knee on the fish and cut strips of dark red meat longitudinally\\nfrom the back of the head to the tail.  They were wedge-shaped strips\\nand he cut them from next to the back bone down to the edge of the\\nbelly.  When he had cut six strips he spread them out on the wood of\\nthe bow, wiped his knife on his trousers, and lifted the carcass of the\\nbonito by the tail and dropped it overboard.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think I can eat an entire one,\" he said and drew his knife\\nacross one of the strips.  He could feel the steady hard pull of the\\nline and his left hand was cramped.  It drew up tight on the heavy cord\\nand he looked at it in disgust.\\n\\n\"What kind of a hand is that,\" he said.  \"Cramp then if you want.  Make\\nyourself into a claw.  It will do you no good.\"\\n\\nCome on, he thought and looked down into the dark water at the slant of\\nthe line.  Eat it now and it will strengthen the hand.  It is not the\\nhand\\'s fault and you have been many hours with the fish.  But you can\\nstay with him forever.  Eat the bonito now.\\n\\nHe picked up a piece and put it in his mouth and chewed it slowly.  It\\nwas not unpleasant.\\n\\nChew it well, he thought, and get all the juices.  It would not be bad\\nto eat with a little lime or with lemon or with salt.\\n\\n\"How do you feel, hand?\" he asked the cramped hand that was almost as\\nstiff as rigor mortis.  \"I\\'ll eat some more for you.\"\\n\\n\\nHe ate the other part of the piece that he had cut in two.  He chewed\\nit carefully and then spat out the skin.\\n\\n\"How does it go, hand?  Or is it too early to know?\"\\n\\nHe took another full piece and chewed it.\\n\\n\"It is a strong full-blooded fish,\" he thought.  \"I was lucky to get\\nhim instead of dolphin.  Dolphin is too sweet.  This is hardly sweet at\\nall and all the strength is still in it.\"\\n\\nThere is no sense in being anything but practical though, he thought.\\nI wish I had some salt.  And I do not know whether the sun will rot or\\ndry what is left, so I had better eat it all although I am not hungry.\\nThe fish is calm and steady.  I will eat it all and then I will be\\nready.\\n\\n\"Be patient, hand,\" he said.  \"I do this for you.\"\\n\\nI wish I could feed the fish, he thought.  He is my brother.  But I\\nmust kill him and keep strong to do it.  Slowly and conscientiously he\\nate all of the wedge-shaped strips of fish.\\n\\nHe straightened up, wiping his hand on his trousers.\\n\\n\"Now,\" he said.  \"You can let the cord go, hand, and I will handle him\\nwith the right arm alone until you stop that nonsense.\"  He put his\\nleft foot on the heavy line that the left hand had held and lay back\\nagainst the pull against his back.\\n\\n\"God help me to have the cramp go,\" he said.  \"Because I do not know\\nwhat the fish is going to do.\"\\n\\nBut he seems calm, he thought, and following his plan.  But what is his\\nplan, he thought.  And what is mine?  Mine I must improvise to his\\nbecause of his great size.  If he will jump I can kill him.  But he\\nstays down forever.  Then I will stay down with him forever.\\n\\nHe rubbed the cramped hand against his trousers and tried to gentle the\\nfingers.  But it would not open.  Maybe it will open with the sun, he\\nthought.  Maybe it will open when the strong raw tuna is digested.  If\\nI have to have it, I will open it, cost whatever it costs.  But I do\\nnot want to open it now by force.  Let it open by itself and come back\\nof its own accord.  After all I abused it much in the night when it was\\nnecessary to free and unite the various lines.\\n\\nHe looked across the sea and knew how alone he was now.  But he could\\nsee the prisms in the deep dark water and the line stretching ahead and\\nthe strange undulation of the calm.  The clouds were building up now\\nfor the trade wind and he looked ahead and saw a flight of wild ducks\\netching themselves against the sky over the water, then blurring, then\\netching again and he knew no man was ever alone on the sea.\\n\\nHe thought of how some men feared being out of sight of land in a small\\nboat and knew they were right in the months of sudden bad weather.  But\\nnow they were in hurricane months and, when there are no hurricanes,\\nthe weather of hurricane months is the best of all the year.\\n\\nIf there is a hurricane you always see the signs of it in the sky for\\ndays ahead, if you are at sea.  They do not see it ashore because they\\ndo not know what to look for, he thought.  The land must make a\\ndifference too, in the shape of the clouds.  But we have no hurricane\\ncoming now.\\n\\nHe looked at the sky and saw the white cumulus built like friendly\\npiles of ice cream and high above were the thin feathers of the cirrus\\nagainst the high September sky.\\n\\n\"Light _brisa_,\" he said.  \"Better weather for me than for you, fish.\"\\n\\nHis left hand was still cramped, but he was unknotting it slowly.\\n\\nI hate a cramp, he thought.  It is a treachery of one\\'s own body.  It\\nis humiliating before others to have a diarrhoea from ptomaine\\npoisoning or to vomit from it.  But a cramp, he thought of it as a\\n_calambre_, humiliates oneself especially when one is alone.\\n\\nIf the boy were here he could rub it for me and loosen it down from the\\nforearm, he thought.  But it will loosen up.\\n\\nThen, with his right hand he felt the difference in the pull of the\\nline before he saw the slant change in the water.  Then, as he leaned\\nagainst the line and slapped his left hand hard and fast against his\\nthigh he saw the line slanting slowly upward.\\n\\n\"He\\'s coming up,\" he said.  \"Come on hand.  Please come on.\"\\n\\nThe line rose slowly and steadily and then the surface of the ocean\\nbulged ahead of the boat and the fish came out.  He came out unendingly\\nand water poured from his sides.  He was bright in the sun and his head\\nand back were dark purple and in the sun the stripes on his sides\\nshowed wide and a light lavender.  His sword was as long as a baseball\\nbat and tapered like a rapier and he rose his full length from the\\nwater and then re-entered it, smoothly, like a diver and the old man\\nsaw the great scythe-blade of his tail go under and the line commenced\\nto race out.\\n\\n\"He is two feet longer than the skiff,\" the old man said.  The line was\\ngoing out fast but steadily and the fish was not panicked.  The old man\\nwas trying with both hands to keep the line just inside of breaking\\nstrength.  He knew that if he could not slow the fish with a steady\\npressure the fish could take out all the line and break it.\\n\\nHe is a great fish and I must convince him, he thought.  I must never\\nlet him learn his strength nor what he could do if he made his run.  If\\nI were him I would put in everything now and go until something broke.\\nBut, thank God, they are not as intelligent as we who kill them;\\nalthough they are more noble and more able.\\n\\nThe old man had seen many great fish.  He had seen many that weighed\\nmore than a thousand pounds and he had caught two of that size in his\\nlife, but never alone.  Now alone, and out of sight of land, he was\\nfast to the biggest fish that he had ever seen and bigger than he had\\never heard of, and his left hand was still as tight as the gripped\\nclaws of an eagle.\\n\\nIt will uncramp though, he thought.  Surely it will uncramp to help my\\nright hand.  There are three things that are brothers: the fish and my\\ntwo hands.  It must uncramp.  It is unworthy of it to be cramped.  The\\nfish had slowed again and was going at his usual pace.\\n\\nI wonder why he jumped, the old man thought.  He jumped almost as\\nthough to show me how big he was.  I know now, anyway, he thought.  I\\nwish I could show him what sort of man I am.  But then he would see the\\ncramped hand.  Let him think I am more man than I am and I will be so.\\nI wish I was the fish, he thought, with everything he has against only\\nmy will and my intelligence.\\n\\nHe settled comfortably against the wood and took his suffering as it\\ncame and the fish swam steadily and the boat moved slowly through the\\ndark water.  There was a small sea rising with the wind coming up from\\nthe east and at noon the old man\\'s left hand was uncramped.\\n\\n\"Bad news for you, fish,\" he said and shifted the line over the sacks\\nthat covered his shoulders.\\n\\nHe was comfortable but suffering, although he did not admit the\\nsuffering at all.\\n\\n\"I am not religious,\" he said.  \"But I will say ten Our Fathers and ten\\nHail Marys that I should catch this fish, and I promise to make a\\npilgrimage to the Virgen de Cobre if I catch him.  That is a promise.\"\\n\\nHe commenced to say his prayers mechanically.  Sometimes he would be so\\ntired that he could not remember the prayer and then he would say them\\nfast so that they would come automatically.  Hail Marys are easier to\\nsay than Our Fathers, he thought.\\n\\n\"Hail Mary full of Grace the Lord is with thee.  Blessed art thou among\\nwomen and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.  Holy Mary, Mother\\nof God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death.  Amen.\"\\nThen he added, \"Blessed Virgin, pray for the death of this fish.\\nWonderful though he is.\"\\n\\nWith his prayers said, and feeling much better, but suffering exactly\\nas much, and perhaps a little more, he leaned against the wood of the\\nbow and began, mechanically, to work the fingers of his left hand.\\n\\nThe sun was hot now although the breeze was rising gently.\\n\\n\"I had better re-bait that little line out over the stern,\" he said.\\n\"If the fish decides to stay another night I will need to eat again and\\nthe water is low in the bottle.  I don\\'t think I can get anything but a\\ndolphin here.  But if I eat him fresh enough he won\\'t be bad.  I wish a\\nflying fish would come on board tonight.  But I have no light to\\nattract them.  A flying fish is excellent to eat raw and I would not\\nhave to cut him up.  I must save all my strength now.  Christ, I did\\nnot know he was so big.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll kill him though,\" he said.  \"In all his greatness and his glory.\"\\n\\nAlthough it is unjust, he thought.  But I will show him what a man can\\ndo and what a man endures.\\n\\n\"I told the boy I was a strange old man,\" he said.  \"Now is when I must\\nprove it.\"\\n\\nThe thousand times that he had proved it meant nothing.  Now he was\\nproving it again.  Each time was a new time and he never thought about\\nthe past when he was doing it.\\n\\nI wish he\\'d sleep and I could sleep and dream about the lions, he\\nthought.  Why are the lions the main thing that is left?  Don\\'t think,\\nold man, he said to himself.  Rest gently now against the wood and\\nthink of nothing.  He is working.  Work as little as you can.\\n\\nIt was getting into the afternoon and the boat still moved slowly and\\nsteadily.  But there was an added drag now from the easterly breeze and\\nthe old man rode gently with the small sea and the hurt of the cord\\nacross his back came to him easily and smoothly.\\n\\nOnce in the afternoon the line started to rise again.  But the fish\\nonly continued to swim at a slightly higher level.  The sun was on the\\nold man\\'s left arm and shoulder and on his back.  So he knew the fish\\nhad turned east of north.\\n\\nNow that he had seen him once, he could picture the fish swimming in\\nthe water with his purple pectoral fins set wide as wings and the great\\nerect tail slicing through the dark.  I wonder how much he sees at that\\ndepth, the old man thought.  His eye is huge and a horse, with much\\nless eye, can see in the dark.  Once I could see quite well in the\\ndark.  Not in the absolute dark.  But almost as a cat sees.\\n\\nThe sun and his steady movement of his fingers had uncramped his left\\nhand now completely and he began to shift more of the strain to it and\\nhe shrugged the muscles of his back to shift the hurt of the cord a\\nlittle.\\n\\n\"If you\\'re not tired, fish,\" he said aloud, \"you must be very strange.\"\\n\\nHe felt very tired now and he knew the night would come soon and he\\ntried to think of other things.  He thought of the Big Leagues, to him\\nthey were the _Gran Ligas_, and he knew that the Yankees of New York\\nwere playing the _Tigres_ of Detroit.\\n\\nThis is the second day now that I do not know the result of the\\n_juegos_, he thought.  But I must have confidence and I must be worthy\\nof the great DiMaggio who does all things perfectly even with the pain\\nof the bone spur in his heel.  What is a bone spur? he asked himself.\\n_Un espuela de hueso_.  We do not have them.  Can it be as painful as\\nthe spur of a fighting cock in one\\'s heel?  I do not think I could\\nendure that or the loss of the eye and of both eyes and continue to\\nfight as the fighting cocks do.  Man is not much beside the great birds\\nand beasts.  Still I would rather be that beast down there in the\\ndarkness of the sea.\\n\\n\"Unless sharks come,\" he said aloud.  \"If sharks come, God pity him and\\nme.\"\\n\\nDo you believe the great DiMaggio would stay with a fish as long as I\\nwill stay with this one? he thought.  I am sure he would and more since\\nhe is young and strong.  Also his father was a fisherman.  But would\\nthe bone spur hurt him too much?\\n\\n\"I do not know,\" he said aloud.  \"I never had a bone spur.\"\\n\\nAs the sun set he remembered, to give himself more confidence, the time\\nin the tavern at Casablanca when he had played the hand game with the\\ngreat negro from Cienfuegos who was the strongest man on the docks.\\nThey had gone one day and one night with their elbows on a chalk line\\non the table and their forearms straight up and their hands gripped\\ntight.  Each one was trying to force the other\\'s hand down onto the\\ntable.  There was much betting and people went in and out of the room\\nunder the kerosene lights and he had looked at the arm and hand of the\\nnegro and at the negro\\'s face.  They changed the referees every four\\nhours after the first eight so that the referees could sleep.  Blood\\ncame out from under the fingernails of both his and the negro\\'s hands\\nand they looked each other in the eye and at their hands and forearms\\nand the bettors went in and out of the room and sat on high chairs\\nagainst the wall and watched.  The walls were painted bright blue and\\nwere of wood and the lamps threw their shadows against them.  The\\nnegro\\'s shadow was huge and it moved on the wall as the breeze moved\\nthe lamps.\\n\\nThe odds would change back and forth all night and they fed the negro\\nrum and lighted cigarettes for him.  Then the negro, after the rum,\\nwould try for a tremendous effort and once he had the old man, who was\\nnot an old man then but was Santiago El Campeon, nearly three inches\\noff balance.  But the old man had raised his hand up to dead even\\nagain.  He was sure then that he had the negro, who was a fine man and\\na great athlete, beaten.  And at daylight when the bettors were asking\\nthat it be called a draw and the referee was shaking his head, he had\\nunleashed his effort and forced the hand of the negro down and down\\nuntil it rested on the wood.  The match had started on a Sunday morning\\nand ended on a Monday morning.  Many of the bettors had asked for a\\ndraw because they had to go to work on the docks loading sacks of sugar\\nor at the Havana Coal Company.  Otherwise everyone would have wanted it\\nto go to a finish.  But he had finished it anyway and before anyone had\\nto go to work.\\n\\nFor a long time after that everyone had called him The Champion and\\nthere had been a return match in the spring.  But not much money was\\nbet and he had won it quite easily since he had broken the confidence\\nof the negro from Cienfuegos in the first match.  After that he had a\\nfew matches and then no more.  He decided that he could beat anyone if\\nhe wanted to badly enough and he decided that it was bad for his right\\nhand for fishing.  He had tried a few practice matches with his left\\nhand.  But his left hand had always been a traitor and would not do\\nwhat he called on it to do and he did not trust it.\\n\\nThe sun will bake it out well now, he thought.  It should not cramp on\\nme again unless it gets too cold in the night.  I wonder what this\\nnight will bring.\\n\\nAn airplane passed over head on its course to Miami and he watched its\\nshadow scaring up the schools of flying fish.\\n\\n\"With so much flying fish there should be dolphin,\" he said, and leaned\\nback on the line to see if it was possible to gain any on his fish.\\nBut he could not and it stayed at the hardness and water-drop shivering\\nthat preceded breaking.  The boat moved ahead slowly and he watched the\\nairplane until he could no longer see it.\\n\\nIt must be very strange in an airplane, he thought.  I wonder what the\\nsea looks like from that height?  They should be able to see the fish\\nwell if they do not fly too high.  I would like to fly very slowly at\\ntwo hundred fathoms high and see the fish from above.  In the turtle\\nboats I was in the cross-trees of the mast-head and even at that height\\nI saw much.  The dolphin look greener from there and you can see their\\nstripes and their purple spots and you can see all of the school as\\nthey swim.  Why is it that all the fast-moving fish of the dark current\\nhave purple backs and usually purple stripes or spots?  The dolphin\\nlooks green of course because he is really golden.  But when he comes\\nto feed, truly hungry, purple stripes show on his sides as on a marlin.\\nCan it be anger, or the greater speed he makes that brings them out?\\n\\nJust before it was dark, as they passed a great island of Sargasso weed\\nthat heaved and swung in the light sea as though the ocean were making\\nlove with something under a yellow blanket, his small line was taken by\\na dolphin.  He saw it first when it jumped in the air, true gold in the\\nlast of the sun and bending and flapping wildly in the air.  It jumped\\nagain and again in the acrobatics of its fear and he worked his way\\nback to the stern and crouching and holding the big line with his right\\nhand and arm, he pulled the dolphin in with his left hand, stepping on\\nthe gained line each time with his bare left foot.  When the fish was\\nat the stern, plunging and cutting from side to side in desperation,\\nthe old man leaned over the stern and lifted the burnished gold fish\\nwith its purple spots over the stern.  Its jaws were working\\nconvulsively in quick bites against the hook and it pounded the bottom\\nof the skiff with its long flat body, its tail and its head until he\\nclubbed it across the shining golden head until it shivered and was\\nstill.\\n\\nThe old man unhooked the fish, rebaited the line with another sardine\\nand tossed it over.  Then he worked his way slowly back to the bow.  He\\nwashed his left hand and wiped it on his trousers.  Then he shifted the\\nheavy line from his right hand to his left and washed his right hand in\\nthe sea while he watched the sun go into the ocean and the slant of the\\nbig cord.\\n\\n\"He hasn\\'t changed at all,\" he said.  But watching the movement of the\\nwater against his hand he noted that it was perceptibly slower.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll lash the two oars together across the stern and that will slow\\nhim in the night,\" he said.  \"He\\'s good for the night and so am I.\"\\n\\nIt would be better to gut the dolphin a little later to save the blood\\nin the meat, he thought.  I can do that a little later and lash the\\noars to make a drag at the same time.  I had better keep the fish quiet\\nnow and not disturb him too much at sunset.  The setting of the sun is\\na difficult time for all fish.\\n\\nHe let his hand dry in the air then grasped the line with it and eased\\nhimself as much as he could and allowed himself to be pulled forward\\nagainst the wood so that the boat took the strain as much, or more,\\nthan he did.\\n\\nI\\'m learning how to do it, he thought.  This part of it anyway.  Then\\ntoo, remember he hasn\\'t eaten since he took the bait and he is huge and\\nneeds much food.  I have eaten the whole bonito.  Tomorrow I will eat\\nthe dolphin.  He called it _dorado_.  Perhaps I should eat some of it\\nwhen I clean it.  It will be harder to eat than the bonito.  But, then,\\nnothing is easy.\\n\\n\"How do you feel, fish?\" he asked aloud.  \"I feel good and my left hand\\nis better and I have food for a night and a day.  Pull the boat, fish.\"\\n\\nHe did not truly feel good because the pain from the cord across his\\nback had almost passed pain and gone into a dullness that he\\nmistrusted.  But I have had worse things than that, he thought.  My\\nhand is only cut a little and the cramp is gone from the other.  My\\nlegs are all right.  Also now I have gained on him in the question of\\nsustenance.\\n\\nIt was dark now as it becomes dark quickly after the sun sets in\\nSeptember.  He lay against the worn wood of the bow and rested all that\\nhe could.  The first stars were out.  He did not know the name of Rigel\\nbut he saw it and knew soon they would all be out and he would have all\\nhis distant friends.\\n\\n\"The fish is my friend too,\" he said aloud.  \"I have never seen or\\nheard of such a fish.  But I must kill him.  I am glad we do not have\\nto try to kill the stars.\"\\n\\nImagine if each day a man must try to kill the moon, he thought.  The\\nmoon runs away.  But imagine if a man each day should have to try to\\nkill the sun?  We were born lucky, he thought.\\n\\nThen he was sorry for the great fish that had nothing to eat and his\\ndetermination to kill him never relaxed in his sorrow for him.  How\\nmany people will he feed, he thought.  But are they worthy to eat him?\\nNo, of course not.  There is no one worthy of eating him from the\\nmanner of his behaviour and his great dignity.\\n\\nI do not understand these things, he thought.  But it is good that we\\ndo not have to try to kill the sun or the moon or the stars.  It is\\nenough to live on the sea and kill our true brothers.\\n\\nNow, he thought, I must think about the drag.  It has its perils and\\nits merits.  I may lose so much line that I will lose him, if he makes\\nhis effort and the drag made by the oars is in place and the boat loses\\nall her lightness.  Her lightness prolongs both our suffering but it is\\nmy safety since he has great speed that he has never yet employed.  No\\nmatter what passes I must gut the dolphin so he does not spoil and eat\\nsome of him to be strong.\\n\\nNow I will rest an hour more and feel that he is solid and steady\\nbefore I move back to the stern to do the work and make the decision.\\nIn the meantime I can see how he acts and if he shows any changes.  The\\noars are a good trick; but it has reached the time to play for safety.\\nHe is much fish still and I saw that the hook was in the corner of his\\nmouth and he has kept his mouth tight shut.  The punishment of the hook\\nis nothing.  The punishment of hunger, and that he is against something\\nthat he does not comprehend, is everything.  Rest now, old man, and let\\nhim work until your next duty comes.\\n\\nHe rested for what he believed to be two hours.  The moon did not rise\\nnow until late and he had no way of judging the time.  Nor was he\\nreally resting except comparatively.  He was still bearing the pull of\\nthe fish across his shoulders but he placed his left hand on the\\ngunwale of the bow and confided more and more of the resistance to the\\nfish to the skiff itself.\\n\\nHow simple it would be if I could make the line fast, he thought.  But\\nwith one small lurch he could break it.  I must cushion the pull of the\\nline with my body and at all times be ready to give line with both\\nhands.\\n\\n\"But you have not slept yet, old man,\" he said aloud.  \"It is half a\\nday and a night and now another day and you have not slept.  You must\\ndevise a way so that you sleep a little if he is quiet and steady.  If\\nyou do not sleep you might become unclear in the head.\"\\n\\nI\\'m clear enough in the head, he thought.  Too clear.  I am as clear as\\nthe stars that are my brothers.  Still I must sleep.  They sleep and\\nthe moon and the sun sleep and even the ocean sleeps sometimes on\\ncertain days when there is no current and a flat calm.\\n\\nBut remember to sleep, he thought.  Make yourself do it and devise some\\nsimple and sure way about the lines.  Now go back and prepare the\\ndolphin.  It is too dangerous to rig the oars as a drag if you must\\nsleep.\\n\\nI could go without sleeping, he told himself.  But it would be too\\ndangerous.\\n\\nHe started to work his way back to the stern on his hands and knees,\\nbeing careful not to jerk against the fish.  He may be half asleep\\nhimself, he thought.  But I do not want him to rest.  He must pull\\nuntil he dies.\\n\\nBack in the stern he turned so that his left hand held the strain of\\nthe line across his shoulders and drew his knife from its sheath with\\nhis right hand.  The stars were bright now and he saw the dolphin\\nclearly and he pushed the blade of his knife into his head and drew him\\n\\nout from under the stern.  He put one of his feet on the fish and slit\\nhim quickly from the vent up to the tip of his lower jaw.  Then he put\\nhis knife down and gutted him with his right hand, scooping him clean\\nand pulling the gills clear.  He felt the maw heavy and slippery in his\\nhands and he slit it open.  There were two flying fish inside.  They\\nwere fresh and hard and he laid them side by side and dropped the guts\\nand the gills over the stern.  They sank leaving a trail of\\nphosphorescence in the water.  The dolphin was cold and a leprous\\ngray-white now in the starlight and the old man skinned one side of him\\nwhile he held his right foot on the fish\\'s head.  Then he turned him\\nover and skinned the other side and cut each side off from the head\\ndown to the tail.\\n\\nHe slid the carcass overboard and looked to see if there was any swirl\\nin the water.  But there was only the light of its slow descent.  He\\nturned then and placed the two flying fish inside the two fillets of\\nfish and putting his knife back in its sheath, he worked his way slowly\\nback to the bow.  His back was bent with the weight of the line across\\nit and he carried the fish in his right hand.\\n\\nBack in the bow he laid the two fillets of fish out on the wood with\\nthe flying fish beside them.  After that he settled the line across his\\nshoulders in a new place and held it again with his left hand resting\\non the gunwale.  Then he leaned over the side and washed the flying\\nfish in the water, noting the speed of the water against his hand.  His\\nhand was phosphorescent from skinning the fish and he watched the flow\\nof the water against it.  The flow was less strong and as he rubbed the\\nside of his hand against the planking of the skiff, particles of\\nphosphorus floated off and drifted slowly astern.\\n\\n\"He is tiring or he is resting,\" the old man said.  \"Now let me get\\nthrough the eating of this dolphin and get some rest and a little\\nsleep.\"\\n\\nUnder the stars and with the night colder all the time he ate half of\\none of the dolphin fillets and one of the flying fish, gutted and with\\nits head cut off.\\n\\n\"What an excellent fish dolphin is to eat cooked,\" he said.  \"And what\\na miserable fish raw.  I will never go in a boat again without salt or\\nlimes.\"\\n\\nIf I had brains I would have splashed water on the bow all day and\\ndrying, it would have made salt, he thought.  But then I did not hook\\nthe dolphin until almost sunset.  Still it was a lack of preparation.\\nBut I have chewed it all well and I am not nauseated.\\n\\nThe sky was clouding over to the east and one after another the stars\\nhe knew were gone.  It looked now as though he were moving into a great\\ncanyon of clouds and the wind had dropped.\\n\\n\"There will be bad weather in three or four days,\" he said.  \"But not\\ntonight and not tomorrow.  Rig now to get some sleep, old man, while\\nthe fish is calm and steady.\"\\n\\nHe held the line tight in his right hand and then pushed his thigh\\nagainst his right hand as he leaned all his weight against the wood of\\nthe bow.  Then he passed the line a little lower on his shoulders and\\nbraced his left hand on it.\\n\\nMy right hand can hold it as long as it is braced, he thought.  If it\\nrelaxes in sleep my left hand will wake me as the line goes out.  It is\\nhard on the right hand.  But he is used to punishment.  Even if I sleep\\ntwenty minutes or a half an hour it is good.  He lay forward cramping\\nhimself against the line with all of his body, putting all his weight\\nonto his right hand, and he was asleep.\\n\\nHe did not dream of the lions but instead of a vast school of porpoises\\nthat stretched for eight or ten miles and it was in the time of their\\nmating and they would leap high into the air and return into the same\\nhole they had made in the water when they leaped.\\n\\nThen he dreamed that he was in the village on his bed and there was a\\nnorther and he was very cold and his right arm was asleep because his\\nhead had rested on it instead of a pillow.\\n\\nAfter that he began to dream of the long yellow beach and he saw the\\nfirst of the lions come down onto it in the early dark and then the\\nother lions came and he rested his chin on the wood of the bows where\\nthe ship lay anchored with the evening off-shore breeze and he waited\\nto see if there would be more lions and he was happy.\\n\\nThe moon had been up for a long time but he slept on and the fish\\npulled on steadily and the boat moved into the tunnel of clouds.\\n\\nHe woke with the jerk of his right fist coming up against his face and\\nthe line burning out through his right hand.  He had no feeling of his\\nleft hand but he braked all he could with his right and the line rushed\\nout.  Finally his left hand found the line and he leaned back against\\nthe line and now it burned his back and his left hand, and his left\\nhand was taking all the strain and cutting badly.  He looked back at\\nthe coils of line and they were feeding smoothly.  Just then the fish\\njumped making a great bursting of the ocean and then a heavy fall.\\nThen he jumped again and again and the boat was going fast although\\nline was still racing out and the old man was raising the strain to\\nbreaking point and raising it to breaking point again and again.  He\\nhad been pulled down tight onto the bow and his face was in the cut\\nslice of dolphin and he could not move.\\n\\nThis is what we waited for, he thought.  So now let us take it.\\n\\nMake him pay for the line, he thought.  Make him pay for it.\\n\\nHe could not see the fish\\'s jumps but only heard the breaking of the\\nocean and the heavy splash as he fell.  The speed of the line was\\ncutting his hands badly but he had always known this would happen and\\nhe tried to keep the cutting across the calloused parts and not let the\\nline slip into the palm nor cut the fingers.\\n\\nIf the boy was here he would wet the coils of line, he thought.  Yes.\\nIf the boy were here.  If the boy were here.\\n\\nThe line went out and out and out but it was slowing now and he was\\nmaking the fish earn each inch of it.  Now he got his head up from the\\nwood and out of the slice of fish that his cheek had crushed.  Then he\\nwas on his knees and then he rose slowly to his feet.  He was ceding\\nline but more slowly all the time.  He worked back to where he could\\nfeel with his foot the coils of line that he could not see.  There was\\nplenty of line still and now the fish had to pull the friction of all\\nthat new line through the water.\\n\\nYes, he thought.  And now he has jumped more than a dozen times and\\nfilled the sacks along his back with air and he cannot go down deep to\\ndie where I cannot bring him up.  He will start circling soon and then\\nI must work on him.  I wonder what started him so suddenly?  Could it\\nhave been hunger that made him desperate, or was he frightened by\\nsomething in the night?  Maybe he suddenly felt fear.  But he was such\\na calm, strong fish and he seemed so fearless and so confident.  It is\\nstrange.\\n\\n\"You better be fearless and confident yourself, old man,\" he said.\\n\"You\\'re holding him again but you cannot get line.  But soon he has to\\ncircle.\"\\n\\nThe old man held him with his left hand and his shoulders now and\\nstooped down and scooped up water in his right hand to get the crushed\\ndolphin flesh off of his face.  He was afraid that it might nauseate\\nhim and he would vomit and lose his strength.  When his face was\\ncleaned he washed his right hand in the water over the side and then\\nlet it stay in the salt water while he watched the first light come\\nbefore the sunrise.  He\\'s headed almost east, he thought.  That means\\nhe is tired and going with the current.  Soon he will have to circle.\\nThen our true work begins.\\n\\nAfter he judged that his right hand had been in the water long enough\\nhe took it out and looked at it.  \"It is not bad,\" he said.  \"And pain\\ndoes not matter to a man.\"\\n\\nHe took hold of the line carefully so that it did not fit into any of\\nthe fresh line cuts and shifted his weight so that he could put his\\nleft hand into the sea on the other side of the skiff.\\n\\n\"You did not do so badly for something worthless,\" he said to his left\\nhand.  \"But there was a moment when I could not find you.\"\\n\\nWhy was I not born with two good hands? he thought.  Perhaps it was my\\nfault in not training that one properly.  But God knows he has had\\nenough chances to learn.  He did not do so badly in the night, though,\\nand he has only cramped once.  If he cramps again let the line cut him\\noff.\\n\\nWhen he thought that he knew that he was not being clear-headed and he\\nthought he should chew some more of the dolphin.  But I can\\'t, he told\\nhimself.  It is better to be light-headed than to lose your strength\\nfrom nausea.  And I know I cannot keep it if I eat it since my face was\\nin it.  I will keep it for an emergency until it goes bad.  But it is\\ntoo late to try for strength now through nourishment.  You\\'re stupid,\\nhe told himself.  Eat the other flying fish.\\n\\nIt was there, cleaned and ready, and he picked it up with his left hand\\nand ate it chewing the bones carefully and eating all of it down to the\\ntail.\\n\\nIt has more nourishment than almost any fish, he thought.  At least the\\nkind of strength that I need.  Now I have done what I can, he thought.\\nLet him begin to circle and let the fight come.\\n\\nThe sun was rising for the third time since he had put to sea when the\\nfish started to circle.\\n\\nHe could not see by the slant of the line that the fish was circling.\\nIt was too early for that.  He just felt a faint slackening of the\\npressure of the line and he commenced to pull on it gently with his\\nright hand.  It tightened, as always, but just when he reached the\\npoint where it would break, line began to come in.  He slipped his\\nshoulders and head from under the line and began to pull in line\\nsteadily and gently.  He used both of his hands in a swinging motion\\nand tried to do the pulling as much as he could with his body and his\\nlegs.  His old legs and shoulders pivoted with the swinging of the\\npulling.\\n\\n\"It is a very big circle,\" he said.  \"But he is circling.\"\\n\\nThen the line would not come in any more and he held it until he saw\\nthe drops jumping from it in the sun.  Then it started out and the old\\nman knelt down and let it go grudgingly back into the dark water.\\n\\n\"He is making the far part of his circle now,\" he said.  I must hold\\nall I can, he thought.  The strain will shorten his circle each time.\\nPerhaps in an hour I will see him.  Now I must convince him and then I\\nmust kill him.\\n\\nBut the fish kept on circling slowly and the old man was wet with sweat\\nand tired deep into his bones two hours later.  But the circles were\\nmuch shorter now and from the way the line slanted he could tell the\\nfish had risen steadily while he swam.\\n\\nFor an hour the old man had been seeing black spots before his eyes and\\nthe sweat salted his eyes and salted the cut over his eye and on his\\nforehead.  He was not afraid of the black spots.  They were normal at\\nthe tension that he was pulling on the line.  Twice, though, he had\\nfelt faint and dizzy and that had worried him.\\n\\n\"I could not fail myself and die on a fish like this,\" he said.  \"Now\\nthat I have him coming so beautifully, God help me endure.  I\\'ll say a\\nhundred Our Fathers and a hundred Hail Marys.  But I cannot say them\\nnow.\"\\n\\nConsider them said, he thought.  I\\'ll say them later.\\n\\nJust then he felt a sudden banging and jerking on the line he held with\\nhis two hands.  It was sharp and hard-feeling and heavy.\\n\\nHe is hitting the wire leader with his spear, he thought.  That was\\nbound to come.  He had to do that.  It may make him jump though and I\\nwould rather he stayed circling now.  The jumps were necessary for him\\nto take air.  But after that each one can widen the opening of the hook\\nwound and he can throw the hook.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t jump, fish,\" he said.  \"Don\\'t jump.\"\\n\\nThe fish hit the wire several times more and each time he shook his\\nhead the old man gave up a little line.\\n\\nI must hold his pain where it is, he thought.  Mine does not matter.  I\\ncan control mine.  But his pain could drive him mad.\\n\\nAfter a while the fish stopped beating at the wire and started circling\\nslowly again.  The old man was gaining line steadily now.  But he felt\\nfaint again.  He lifted some sea water with his left hand and put it on\\nhis head.  Then he put more on and rubbed the back of his neck.\\n\\n\"I have no cramps,\" he said.  \"He\\'ll be up soon and I can last.  You\\nhave to last.  Don\\'t even speak of it.\"\\n\\nHe kneeled against the bow and, for a moment, slipped the line over his\\nback again.  I\\'ll rest now while he goes out on the circle and then\\nstand up and work on him when he comes in, he decided.\\n\\nIt was a great temptation to rest in the bow and let the fish make one\\ncircle by himself without recovering any line.  But when the strain\\nshowed the fish had turned to come toward the boat, the old man rose to\\nhis feet and started the pivoting and the weaving pulling that brought\\nin all the line he gained.\\n\\nI\\'m tireder than I have ever been, he thought, and now the trade wind\\nis rising.  But that will be good to take him in with.  I need that\\nbadly.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll rest on the next turn as he goes out,\" he said.  \"I feel much\\nbetter.  Then in two or three turns more I will have him.\"\\n\\nHis straw hat was far on the back of his head and he sank down into the\\nbow with the pull of the line as he felt the fish turn.\\n\\nYou work now, fish, he thought.  I\\'ll take you at the turn.\\n\\nThe sea had risen considerably.  But it was a fair-weather breeze and\\nhe had to have it to get home.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll just steer south and west,\" he said.  \"A man is never lost at sea\\nand it is a long island.\"\\n\\nIt was on the third turn that he saw the fish first.\\n\\nHe saw him first as a dark shadow that took so long to pass under the\\nboat that he could not believe its length.\\n\\n\"No,\" he said.  \"He can\\'t be that big.\"\\n\\nBut he was that big and at the end of this circle he came to the\\nsurface only thirty yards away and the man saw his tail out of water.\\nIt was higher than a big scythe blade and a very pale lavender above\\nthe dark blue water.  It raked back and as the fish swam just below the\\nsurface the old man could see his huge bulk and the purple stripes that\\nbanded him.  His dorsal fin was down and his huge pectorals were spread\\nwide.\\n\\nOn this circle the old man could see the fish\\'s eye and the two gray\\nsucking fish that swam around him.  Sometimes they attached themselves\\nto him.  Sometimes they darted off.  Sometimes they would swim easily\\nin his shadow.  They were each over three feet long and when they swam\\nfast they lashed their whole bodies like eels.\\n\\nThe old man was sweating now but from something else besides the sun.\\nOn each calm placid turn the fish made he was gaining line and he was\\nsure that in two turns more he would have a chance to get the harpoon\\nin.\\n\\nBut I must get him close, close, close, he thought.  I mustn\\'t try for\\nthe head.  I must get the heart.\\n\\n\"Be calm and strong, old man,\" he said.\\n\\nOn the next circle the fish\\'s back was out but he was a little too far\\nfrom the boat.  On the next circle he was still too far away but he was\\nhigher out of water and the old man was sure that by gaining some more\\nline he could have him alongside.\\n\\nHe had rigged his harpoon long before and its coil of light rope was in\\na round basket and the end was made fast to the bitt in the bow.\\n\\nThe fish was coming in on his circle now calm and beautiful looking and\\nonly his great tail moving.  The old man pulled on him all that he\\ncould to bring him closer.  For just a moment the fish turned a little\\non his side.  Then he straightened himself and began another circle.\\n\\n\"I moved him,\" the old man said.  \"I moved him then.\"\\n\\nHe felt faint again now but he held on the great fish all the strain\\nthat he could.  I moved him, he thought.  Maybe this time I can get him\\nover.  Pull, hands, he thought.  Hold up, legs.  Last for me, head.\\nLast for me.  You never went.  This time I\\'ll pull him over.\\n\\nBut when he put all of his effort on, starting it well out before the\\nfish came alongside and pulling with all his strength, the fish pulled\\npart way over and then righted himself and swam away.\\n\\n\"Fish,\" the old man said.  \"Fish, you are going to have to die anyway.\\nDo you have to kill me too?\"\\n\\nThat way nothing is accomplished, he thought.  His mouth was too dry to\\nspeak but he could not reach for the water now.  I must get him\\nalongside this time, he thought.  I am not good for many more turns.\\nYes you are, he told himself.  You\\'re good for ever.\\n\\nOn the next turn, he nearly had him.  But again the fish righted\\nhimself and swam slowly away.\\n\\nYou are killing me, fish, the old man thought.  But you have a right\\nto.  Never have I seen a greater, or more beautiful, or a calmer or\\nmore noble thing than you, brother.  Come on and kill me.  I do not\\ncare who kills who.\\n\\nNow you are getting confused in the head, he thought.  You must keep\\nyour head clear.  Keep your head clear and know how to suffer like a\\nman.  Or a fish, he thought.\\n\\n\"Clear up, head,\" he said in a voice he could hardly hear.  \"Clear up.\"\\n\\nTwice more it was the same on the turns.\\n\\nI do not know, the old man thought.  He had been on the point of\\nfeeling himself go each time.  I do not know.  But I will try it once\\nmore.\\n\\nHe tried it once more and he felt himself going when he turned the\\nfish.  The fish righted himself and swam off again slowly with the\\ngreat tail weaving in the air.\\n\\nI\\'ll try it again, the old man promised, although his hands were mushy\\nnow and he could only see well in flashes.\\n\\nHe tried it again and it was the same.  So, he thought, and he felt\\nhimself going before he started; I will try it once again.\\n\\nHe took all his pain and what was left of his strength and his long\\ngone pride and he put it against the fish\\'s agony and the fish came\\nover onto his side and swam gently on his side, his bill almost\\ntouching the planking of the skiff and started to pass the boat, long,\\ndeep, wide, silver and barred with purple and interminable in the water.\\n\\nThe old man dropped the line and put his foot on it and lifted the\\nharpoon as high as he could and drove it down with all his strength,\\nand more strength he had just summoned, into the fish\\'s side just\\nbehind the great chest fin that rose high in the air to the altitude of\\nthe man\\'s chest.  He felt the iron go in and he leaned on it and drove\\nit further and then pushed all his weight after it.\\n\\nThen the fish came alive, with his death in him, and rose high out of\\nthe water showing all his great length and width and all his power and\\nhis beauty.  He seemed to hang in the air above the old man in the\\nskiff.  Then he fell into the water with a crash that sent spray over\\nthe old man and over all of the skiff.\\n\\nThe old man felt faint and sick and he could not see well.  But he\\ncleared the harpoon line and let it run slowly through his raw hands\\nand, when he could see, he saw the fish was on his back with his silver\\nbelly up.  The shaft of the harpoon was projecting at an angle from the\\nfish\\'s shoulder and the sea was discolouring with the red of the blood\\nfrom his heart.  First it was dark as a shoal in the blue water that\\nwas more than a mile deep.  Then it spread like a cloud.  The fish was\\nsilvery and still and floated with the waves.\\n\\nThe old man looked carefully in the glimpse of vision that he had.\\nThen he took two turns of the harpoon line around the bitt in the bow\\nand laid his head on his hands.\\n\\n\"Keep my head clear,\" he said against the wood of the bow.  \"I am a\\ntired old man.  But I have killed this fish which is my brother and now\\nI must do the slave work.\"\\n\\nNow I must prepare the nooses and the rope to lash him alongside, he\\nthought.  Even if we were two and swamped her to load him and bailed\\nher out, this skiff would never hold him.  I must prepare everything,\\nthen bring him in and lash him well and step the mast and set sail for\\nhome.\\n\\nHe started to pull the fish in to have him alongside so that he could\\npass a line through his gills and out his mouth and make his head fast\\nalongside the bow.  I want to see him, he thought, and to touch and to\\nfeel him.  He is my fortune, he thought.  But that is not why I wish to\\nfeel him.  I think I felt his heart, he thought.  When I pushed on the\\nharpoon shaft the second time.  Bring him in now and make him fast and\\nget the noose around his tail and another around his middle to bind him\\nto the skiff.\\n\\n\"Get to work, old man,\" he said.  He took a very small drink of the\\nwater.  \"There is very much slave work to be done now that the fight is\\nover.\"\\n\\nHe looked up at the sky and then out to his fish.  He looked at the sun\\ncarefully.  It is not much more than noon, he thought.  And the trade\\nwind is rising.  The lines all mean nothing now.  The boy and I will\\nsplice them when we are home.\\n\\n\"Come on, fish,\" he said.  But the fish did not come.  Instead he lay\\nthere wallowing now in the seas and the old man pulled the skiff up\\nonto him.\\n\\nWhen he was even with him and had the fish\\'s head against the bow he\\ncould not believe his size.  But he untied the harpoon rope from the\\nbitt, passed it through the fish\\'s gills and out his jaws, made a turn\\naround his sword then passed the rope through the other gill, made\\nanother turn around the bill and knotted the double rope and made it\\nfast to the bitt in the bow.  He cut the rope then and went astern to\\nnoose the tail.  The fish had turned silver from his original purple\\nand silver, and the stripes showed the same pale violet colour as his\\ntail.  They were wider than a man\\'s hand with his fingers spread and\\nthe fish\\'s eye looked as detached as the mirrors in a periscope or as a\\nsaint in a procession.\\n\\n\"It was the only way to kill him,\" the old man said.  He was feeling\\nbetter since the water and he knew he would not go away and his head\\nwas clear.  He\\'s over fifteen hundred pounds the way he is, he thought.\\nMaybe much more.  If he dresses out two-thirds of that at thirty cents\\na pound?\\n\\n\"I need a pencil for that,\" he said.  \"My head is not that clear.  But\\nI think the great DiMaggio would be proud of me today.  I had no bone\\nspurs.  But the hands and the back hurt truly.\"  I wonder what a bone\\nspur is, he thought.  Maybe we have them without knowing of it.\\n\\nHe made the fish fast to bow and stern and to the middle thwart.  He\\nwas so big it was like lashing a much bigger skiff alongside.  He cut a\\npiece of line and tied the fish\\'s lower jaw against his bill so his\\nmouth would not open and they would sail as cleanly as possible.  Then\\nhe stepped the mast and, with the stick that was his gaff and with his\\nboom rigged, the patched sail drew, the boat began to move, and half\\nlying in the stern he sailed south-west.\\n\\nHe did not need a compass to tell him where south-west was.  He only\\nneeded the feel of the trade wind and the drawing of the sail.  I\\nbetter put a small line out with a spoon on it and try and get\\nsomething to eat and drink for the moisture.  But he could not find a\\nspoon and his sardines were rotten.  So he hooked a patch of yellow\\ngulf weed with the gaff as they passed and shook it so that the small\\nshrimps that were in it fell onto the planking of the skiff.  There\\nwere more than a dozen of them and they jumped and kicked like sand\\nfleas.  The old man pinched their heads off with his thumb and\\nforefinger and ate them chewing up the shells and the tails.  They were\\nvery tiny but he knew they were nourishing and they tasted good.\\n\\nThe old man still had two drinks of water in the bottle and he used\\nhalf of one after he had eaten the shrimps.  The skiff was sailing well\\nconsidering the handicaps and he steered with the tiller under his arm.\\nHe could see the fish and he had only to look at his hands and feel his\\nback against the stern to know that this had truly happened and was not\\na dream.  At one time when he was feeling so badly toward the end, he\\nhad thought perhaps it was a dream.  Then when he had seen the fish\\ncome out of the water and hang motionless in the sky before he fell, he\\nwas sure there was some great strangeness and he could not believe it.\\nThen he could not see well, although now he saw as well as ever.\\n\\nNow he knew there was the fish and his hands and back were no dream.\\nThe hands cure quickly, he thought.  I bled them clean and the salt\\nwater will heal them.  The dark water of the true gulf is the greatest\\nhealer that there is.  All I must do is keep the head clear.  The hands\\nhave done their work and we sail well.  With his mouth shut and his\\ntail straight up and down we sail like brothers.  Then his head started\\nto become a little unclear and he thought, is he bringing me in or am I\\nbringing him in?  If I were towing him behind there would be no\\nquestion.  Nor if the fish were in the skiff, with all dignity gone,\\nthere would be no question either.  But they were sailing together\\nlashed side by side and the old man thought, let him bring me in if it\\npleases him.  I am only better than him through trickery and he meant\\nme no harm.\\n\\nThey sailed well and the old man soaked his hands in the salt water and\\ntried to keep his head clear.  There were high cumulus clouds and\\nenough cirrus above them so that the old man knew the breeze would last\\nall night.  The old man looked at the fish constantly to make sure it\\nwas true.  It was an hour before the first shark hit him.\\n\\nThe shark was not an accident.  He had come up from deep down in the\\nwater as the dark cloud of blood had settled and dispersed in the mile\\ndeep sea.  He had come up so fast and absolutely without caution that\\nhe broke the surface of the blue water and was in the sun.  Then he\\nfell back into the sea and picked up the scent and started swimming on\\nthe course the skiff and the fish had taken.\\n\\nSometimes he lost the scent.  But he would pick it up again, or have\\njust a trace of it, and he swam fast and hard on the course.  He was a\\nvery big Mako shark built to swim as fast as the fastest fish in the\\nsea and everything about him was beautiful except his jaws.\\n\\nHis back was as blue as a sword fish\\'s and his belly was silver and his\\nhide was smooth and handsome.  He was built as a sword fish except for\\nhis huge jaws which were tight shut now as he swam fast, just under the\\nsurface with his high dorsal fin knifing through the water without\\nwavering.  Inside the closed double lip of his jaws all of his eight\\nrows of teeth were slanted inwards.  They were not the ordinary\\npyramid-shaped teeth of most sharks.  They were shaped like a man\\'s\\nfingers when they are crisped like claws.  They were nearly as long as\\nthe fingers of the old man and they had razor-sharp cutting edges on\\nboth sides.  This was a fish built to feed on all the fishes in the\\nsea, that were so fast and strong and well armed that they had no other\\nenemy.  Now he speeded up as he smelled the fresher scent and his blue\\ndorsal fin cut the water.\\n\\nWhen the old man saw him coming he knew that this was a shark that had\\nno fear at all and would do exactly what he wished.  He prepared the\\nharpoon and made the rope fast while he watched the shark come on.  The\\nrope was short as it lacked what he had cut away to lash the fish.\\n\\nThe old man\\'s head was clear and good now and he was full of resolution\\nbut he had little hope.  It was too good to last, he thought.  He took\\none look at the great fish as he watched the shark close in.  It might\\nas well have been a dream, he thought.  I cannot keep him from hitting\\nme but maybe I can get him.  _Dentuso_, he thought.  Bad luck to your\\nmother.\\n\\nThe shark closed fast astern and when he hit the fish the old man saw\\nhis mouth open and his strange eyes and the clicking chop of the teeth\\nas he drove forward in the meat just above the tail.  The shark\\'s head\\nwas out of water and his back was coming out and the old man could hear\\nthe noise of skin and flesh ripping on the big fish when he rammed the\\nharpoon down onto the shark\\'s head at a spot where the line between his\\neyes intersected with the line that ran straight back from his nose.\\nThere were no such lines.  There was only the heavy sharp blue head and\\nthe big eyes and the clicking, thrusting all-swallowing jaws.  But that\\nwas the location of the brain and the old man hit it.  He hit it with\\nhis blood mushed hands driving a good harpoon with all his strength.\\nHe hit it without hope but with resolution and complete malignancy.\\n\\nThe shark swung over and the old man saw his eye was not alive and then\\nhe swung over once again, wrapping himself in two loops of the rope.\\nThe old man knew that he was dead but the shark would not accept it.\\nThen, on his back, with his tail lashing and his jaws clicking, the\\nshark plowed over the water as a speed-boat does.  The water was white\\nwhere his tail beat it and three-quarters of his body was clear above\\nthe water when the rope came taut, shivered, and then snapped.  The\\nshark lay quietly for a little while on the surface and the old man\\nwatched him.  Then he went down very slowly.\\n\\n\"He took about forty pounds,\" the old man said aloud.  He took my\\nharpoon too and all the rope, he thought, and now my fish bleeds again\\nand there will be others.\\n\\nHe did not like to look at the fish anymore since he had been\\nmutilated.  When the fish had been hit it was as though he himself were\\nhit.\\n\\nBut I killed the shark that hit my fish, he thought.  And he was the\\nbiggest _dentuso_ that I have ever seen.  And God knows that I have\\nseen big ones.\\n\\nIt was too good to last, he thought.  I wish it had been a dream now\\nand that I had never hooked the fish and was alone in bed on the\\nnewspapers.\\n\\n\"But man is not made for defeat,\" he said.  \"A man can be destroyed but\\nnot defeated.\"  I am sorry that I killed the fish though, he thought.\\nNow the bad time is coming and I do not even have the harpoon.  The\\n_dentuso_ is cruel and able and strong and intelligent.  But I was more\\nintelligent that he was.  Perhaps not, he thought.  Perhaps I was only\\nbetter armed.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t think, old man,\" he said aloud.  \"Sail on this course and take\\nit when it comes.\"\\n\\nBut I must think, he thought.  Because it is all I have left.  That and\\nbaseball.  I wonder how the great DiMaggio would have liked the way I\\nhit him in the brain?  It was no great thing, he thought.  Any man\\ncould do it.  But do you think my hands were as great a handicap as the\\nbone spurs?  I cannot know.  I never had anything wrong with my heel\\nexcept the time the sting ray stung it when I stepped on him when\\nswimming and paralyzed the lower leg and made the unbearable pain.\\n\\n\"Think about something cheerful, old man,\" he said.  \"Every minute now\\nyou are closer to home.  You sail lighter for the loss of forty pounds.\"\\n\\nHe knew quite well the pattern of what could happen when he reached the\\ninner part of the current.  But there was nothing to be done now.\\n\\n\"Yes there is,\" he said aloud.  \"I can lash my knife to the butt of one\\nof the oars.\"\\n\\nSo he did that with the tiller under his arm and the sheet of the sail\\nunder his foot.\\n\\n\"Now,\" he said.  \"I am still an old man.  But I am not unarmed.\"\\n\\nThe breeze was fresh now and he sailed on well.  He watched only the\\nforward part of the fish and some of his hope returned.\\n\\nIt is silly not to hope, he thought.  Besides I believe it is a sin.\\nDo not think about sin, he thought.  There are enough problems now\\nwithout sin.  Also I have no understanding of it.\\n\\nI have no understanding of it and I am not sure that I believe in it.\\nPerhaps it was a sin to kill the fish.  I suppose it was even though I\\ndid it to keep me alive and feed many people.  But then everything is a\\nsin.  Do not think about sin.  It is much too late for that and there\\nare people who are paid to do it.  Let them think about it.  You were\\nborn to be a fisherman as the fish was born to be a fish.  San Pedro\\nwas a fisherman as was the father of the great DiMaggio.\\n\\nBut he liked to think about all things that he was involved in and\\nsince there was nothing to read and he did not have a radio, he thought\\nmuch and he kept on thinking about sin.  You did not kill the fish only\\nto keep alive and to sell for food, he thought.  You killed him for\\npride and because you are a fisherman.  You loved him when he was alive\\nand you loved him after.  It you love him, it is not a sin to kill him.\\nOr is it more?\\n\\n\"You think too much, old man,\" he said aloud.\\n\\nBut you enjoyed killing the _dentuso_, he thought.  He lives on the\\nlive fish as you do.  He is not a scavenger nor just a moving appetite\\nas some sharks are.  He is beautiful and noble and knows no fear of\\nanything.\\n\\n\"I killed him in self-defense,\" the old man said aloud.  \"And I killed\\nhim well.\"\\n\\nBesides, he thought, everything kills everything else in some way.\\nFishing kills me exactly as it keeps me alive.  The boy keeps me alive,\\nhe thought.  I must not deceive myself too much.\\n\\nHe leaned over the side and pulled loose a piece of the meat of the\\nfish where the shark had cut him.  He chewed it and noted its quality\\nand its good taste.  It was firm and juicy, like meat, but it was not\\nred.  There was no stringiness in it and he knew that it would bring\\nthe highest price in the market.  But there was no way to keep its\\nscent out of the water and the old man knew that a very bad time was\\ncoming.\\n\\nThe breeze was steady.  It had backed a little further into the\\nnorth-east and he knew that meant that it would not fall off.  The old\\nman looked ahead of him but he could see no sails nor could he see the\\nhull nor the smoke of any ship.  There were only the flying fish that\\nwent up from his bow sailing away to either side and the yellow patches\\nof gulf-weed.  He could not even see a bird.\\n\\nHe had sailed for two hours, resting in the stern and sometimes chewing\\na bit of the meat from the marlin, trying to rest and to be strong,\\nwhen he saw the first of the two sharks.\\n\\n\"_Ay_,\" he said aloud.  There is no translation for this word and\\nperhaps it is just a noise such as a man might make, involuntarily,\\nfeeling the nail go through his hands and into the wood.\\n\\n\"_Galanos_,\" he said aloud.  He had seen the second fin now coming up\\nbehind the first and had identified them as shovel-nosed sharks by the\\nbrown, triangular fin and the sweeping movements of the tail.  They had\\nthe scent and were excited and in the stupidity of their great hunger\\nthey were losing and finding the scent in their excitement.  But they\\nwere closing all the time.\\n\\nThe old man made the sheet fast and jammed the tiller.  Then he took up\\nthe oar with the knife lashed to it.  He lifted it as lightly as he\\ncould because his hands rebelled at the pain.  Then he opened and\\nclosed them on it lightly to loosen them.  He closed them firmly so\\nthey would take the pain now and would not flinch and watched the\\nsharks come.  He could see their wide, flattened, shovel-pointed heads\\nnow and their white-tipped wide pectoral fins.  They were hateful\\nsharks, bad smelling, scavengers as well as killers, and when they were\\nhungry they would bite at an oar or the rudder of a boat.  It was these\\nsharks that would cut the turtles\\' legs and flippers off when the\\nturtles were asleep on the surface, and they would hit a man in the\\nwater, if they were hungry, even if the man had no smell of fish blood\\nnor of fish slime on him.\\n\\n\"_Ay_,\" the old man said.  \"_Galanos_.  Come on, _Galanos_.\"\\n\\nThey came.  But they did not come as the Mako had come.  One turned and\\nwent out of sight under the skiff and the old man could feel the skiff\\nshake as he jerked and pulled on the fish.  The other watched the old\\nman with his slitted yellow eyes and then came in fast with his half\\ncircle of jaws wide to hit the fish where he had already been bitten.\\nThe line showed clearly on the top of his brown head and back where the\\nbrain joined the spinal cord and the old man drove the knife on the oar\\ninto the juncture, withdrew it, and drove it in again into the shark\\'s\\nyellow cat-like eyes.  The shark let go of the fish and slid down,\\nswallowing what he had taken as he died.\\n\\nThe skiff was still shaking with the destruction the other shark was\\ndoing to the fish and the old man let go the sheet so that the skiff\\nwould swing broadside and bring the shark out from under.  When he saw\\nthe shark he leaned over the side and punched at him.  He hit only meat\\nand the hide was set hard and he barely got the knife in.  The blow\\nhurt not only his hands but his shoulder too.  But the shark came up\\nfast with his head out and the old man hit him squarely in the center\\nof his flat-topped head as his nose came out of water and lay against\\nthe fish.  The old man withdrew the blade and punched the shark exactly\\nin the same spot again.  He still hung to the fish with his jaws hooked\\nand the old man stabbed him in his left eye.  The shark still hung\\nthere.\\n\\n\"No?\" the old man said and he drove the blade between the vertebrae and\\nthe brain.  It was an easy shot now and he felt the cartilage sever.\\nThe old man reversed the oar and put the blade between the shark\\'s jaws\\nto open them.  He twisted the blade and as the shark slid loose he\\nsaid, \"Go on, _galano_.  Slide down a mile deep.  Go see your friend,\\nor maybe it\\'s your mother.\"\\n\\nThe old man wiped the blade of his knife and laid down the oar.  Then\\nhe found the sheet and the sail filled and he brought the skiff onto\\nher course.\\n\\n\"They must have taken a quarter of him and of the best meat,\" he said\\naloud.  \"I wish it were a dream and that I had never hooked him.  I\\'m\\nsorry about it, fish.  It makes everything wrong.\"  He stopped and he\\ndid not want to look at the fish now.  Drained of blood and awash he\\nlooked the colour of the silver backing of a mirror and his stripes\\nstill showed.\\n\\n\"I shouldn\\'t have gone out so far, fish,\" he said.  \"Neither for you\\nnor for me.  I\\'m sorry, fish.\"\\n\\nNow, he said to himself.  Look to the lashing on the knife and see if\\nit has been cut.  Then get your hand in order because there still is\\nmore to come.\\n\\n\"I wish I had a stone for the knife,\" the old man said after he had\\nchecked the lashing on the oar butt.  \"I should have brought a stone.\"\\nYou should have brought many things, he thought.  But you did not bring\\nthem, old man.  Now is no time to think of what you do not have.  Think\\nof what you can do with what there is.\\n\\n\"You give me much good counsel,\" he said aloud.  \"I\\'m tired of it.\"\\n\\nHe held the tiller under his arm and soaked both his hands in the water\\nas the skiff drove forward.\\n\\n\"God knows how much that last one took,\" he said.  \"But she\\'s much\\nlighter now.\"  He did not want to think of the mutilated under-side of\\nthe fish.  He knew that each of the jerking bumps of the shark had been\\nmeat torn away and that the fish now made a trail for all sharks as\\nwide as a highway through the sea.\\n\\nHe was a fish to keep a man all winter, he thought.  Don\\'t think of\\nthat.  Just rest and try to get your hands in shape to defend what is\\nleft of him.  The blood smell from my hands means nothing now with all\\nthat scent in the water.  Besides they do not bleed much.  There is\\nnothing cut that means anything.  The bleeding may keep the left from\\ncramping.\\n\\nWhat can I think of now? he thought.  Nothing.  I must think of nothing\\nand wait for the next ones.  I wish it had really been a dream, he\\nthought.  But who knows?  It might have turned out well.\\n\\nThe next shark that came was a single shovel-nose.  He came like a pig\\nto the trough if a pig had a mouth so wide that you could put your head\\nin it.  The old man let him hit the fish and then drove the knife on\\nthe oar down into his brain.  But the shark jerked backwards as he\\nrolled and the knife blade snapped.\\n\\nThe old man settled himself to steer.  He did not even watch the big\\nshark sinking slowly in the water, showing first life-size, then small,\\nthen tiny.  That always fascinated the old man.  But he did not even\\nwatch it now.\\n\\n\"I have the gaff now,\" he said.  \"But it will do no good.  I have the\\ntwo oars and the tiller and the short club.\"\\n\\nNow they have beaten me, he thought.  I am too old to club sharks to\\ndeath.  But I will try it as long as I have the oars and the short club\\nand the tiller.\\n\\nHe put his hands in the water again to soak them.  It was getting late\\nin the afternoon and he saw nothing but the sea and the sky.  There was\\nmore wind in the sky than there had been, and soon he hoped that he\\nwould see land.\\n\\n\"You\\'re tired, old man,\" he said.  \"You\\'re tired inside.\"\\n\\nThe sharks did not hit him again until just before sunset.\\n\\nThe old man saw the brown fins coming along the wide trail the fish\\nmust make in the water.  They were not even quartering on the scent.\\nThey were headed straight for the skiff swimming side by side.\\n\\nHe jammed the tiller, made the sheet fast and reached under the stern\\nfor the club.  It was an oar handle from a broken oar sawed off to\\nabout two and a half feet in length.  He could only use it effectively\\nwith one hand because of the grip of the handle and he took good hold\\nof it with his right hand, flexing his hand on it, as he watched the\\nsharks come.  They were both _galanos_.\\n\\nI must let the first one get a good hold and hit him on the point of\\nthe nose or straight across the top of the head, he thought.\\n\\nThe two sharks closed together and as he saw the one nearest him open\\nhis jaws and sink them into the silver side of the fish, he raised the\\nclub high and brought it down heavy and slamming onto the top of the\\nshark\\'s broad head.  He felt the rubbery solidity as the club came\\ndown.  But he felt the rigidity of bone too and he struck the shark\\nonce more hard across the point of the nose as he slid down from the\\nfish.\\n\\nThe other shark had been in and out and now came in again with his jaws\\nwide.  The old man could see pieces of the meat of the fish spilling\\nwhite from the corner of his jaws as he bumped the fish and closed his\\njaws.  He swung at him and hit only the head and the shark looked at\\nhim and wrenched the meat loose.  The old man swung the club down on\\nhim again as he slipped away to swallow and hit only the heavy solid\\nrubberiness.\\n\\n\"Come on, _galano_,\" the old man said.  \"Come in again.\"\\n\\nThe shark came in a rush and the old man hit him as he shut his jaws.\\nHe hit him solidly and from as high up as he could raise the club.\\nThis time he felt the bone at the base of the brain and he hit him\\nagain in the same place while the shark tore the meat loose sluggishly\\nand slid down from the fish.\\n\\nThe old man watched for him to come again but neither shark showed.\\nThen he saw one on the surface swimming in circles.  He did not see the\\nfin of the other.\\n\\nI could not expect to kill them, he thought.  I could have in my time.\\nBut I have hurt them both badly and neither one can feel very good.  If\\nI could have used a bat with two hands I could have killed the first\\none surely.  Even now, he thought.\\n\\nHe did not want to look at the fish.  He knew that half of him had been\\ndestroyed.  The sun had gone down while he had been in the fight with\\nthe sharks.\\n\\n\"It will be dark soon,\" he said.  \"Then I should see the glow of\\nHavana.  If I am too far to the eastward I will see the lights of one\\nof the new beaches.\"\\n\\nI cannot be too far out now, he thought.  I hope no one has been too\\nworried.  There is only the boy to worry, of course.  But I am sure he\\nwould have confidence.  Many of the older fishermen will worry.  Many\\nothers too, he thought.  I live in a good town.\\n\\nHe could not talk to the fish anymore because the fish had been ruined\\ntoo badly.  Then something came into his head.\\n\\n\"Half fish,\" he said.  \"Fish that you were.  I am sorry that I went too\\nfar out.  I ruined us both.  But we have killed many sharks, you and I,\\nand ruined many others.  How many did you ever kill, old fish?  You do\\nnot have that spear on your head for nothing.\"\\n\\nHe liked to think of the fish and what he could do to a shark if he\\nwere swimming free.  I should have chopped the bill off to fight them\\nwith, he thought.  But there was no hatchet and then there was no knife.\\n\\nBut if I had, and could have lashed it to an oar butt, what a weapon.\\nThen we might have fought them together.  What will you do now if they\\ncome in the night?  What can you do?\\n\\n\"Fight them,\" he said.  \"I\\'ll fight them until I die.\"\\n\\nBut in the dark now and no glow showing and no lights and only the wind\\nand the steady pull of the sail he felt that perhaps he was already\\ndead.  He put his two hands together and felt the palms.  They were not\\ndead and he could bring the pain of life by simply opening and closing\\nthem.  He leaned his back against the stern and knew he was not dead.\\nHis shoulders told him.\\n\\nI have all those prayers I promised if I caught the fish, he thought.\\nBut I am too tired to say them now.  I better get the sack and put it\\nover my shoulders.\\n\\nHe lay in the stern and steered and watched for the glow to come in the\\nsky.  I have half of him, he thought.  Maybe I\\'ll have the luck to\\nbring the forward half in.  I should have some luck.  No, he said.  You\\nviolated your luck when you went too far outside.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be silly,\" he said aloud.  \"And keep awake and steer.  You may\\nhave much luck yet.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d like to buy some if there\\'s any place they sell it,\" he said.\\n\\nWhat could I buy it with? he asked himself.  Could I buy it with a lost\\nharpoon and a broken knife and two bad hands?\\n\\n\"You might,\" he said.  \"You tried to buy it with eighty-four days at\\nsea.  They nearly sold it to you too.\"\\n\\nI must not think nonsense, he thought.  Luck is a thing that comes in\\nmany forms and who can recognize her?  I would take some though in any\\nform and pay what they asked.  I wish I could see the glow from the\\nlights, he thought.  I wish too many things.  But that is the thing I\\nwish for now.  He tried to settle more comfortably to steer and from\\nhis pain he knew he was not dead.\\n\\nHe saw the reflected glare of the lights of the city at what must have\\nbeen around ten o\\'clock at night.  They were only perceptible at first\\nas the light is in the sky before the moon rises.  Then they were\\nsteady to see across the ocean which was rough now with the increasing\\nbreeze.  He steered inside of the glow and he thought that now, soon,\\nhe must hit the edge of the stream.\\n\\nNow it is over, he thought.  They will probably hit me again.  But what\\ncan a man do against them in the dark without a weapon?\\n\\nHe was stiff and sore now and his wounds and all of the strained parts\\nof his body hurt with the cold of the night.  I hope I do not have to\\nfight again, he thought.  I hope so much I do not have to fight again.\\n\\nBut by midnight he fought and this time he knew the fight was useless.\\nThey came in a pack and he could only see the lines in the water that\\ntheir fins made and their phosphorescence as they threw themselves on\\nthe fish.  He clubbed at heads and heard the jaws chop and the shaking\\nof the skiff as they took hold below.  He clubbed desperately at what\\nhe could only feel and hear and he felt something seize the club and it\\nwas gone.\\n\\nHe jerked the tiller free from the rudder and beat and chopped with it,\\nholding it in both hands and driving it down again and again.  But they\\nwere up to the bow now and driving in one after the other and together,\\ntearing off the pieces of meat that showed glowing below the sea as\\nthey turned to come once more.\\n\\nOne came, finally, against the head itself and he knew that it was\\nover.  He swung the tiller across the shark\\'s head where the jaws were\\ncaught in the heaviness of the fish\\'s head which would not tear.  He\\nswung it once and twice and again.  He heard the tiller break and he\\nlunged at the shark with the splintered butt.  He felt it go in and\\nknowing it was sharp he drove it in again.  The shark let go and rolled\\naway.  That was the last shark of the pack that came.  There was\\nnothing more for them to eat.\\n\\nThe old man could hardly breathe now and he felt a strange taste in his\\nmouth.  It was coppery and sweet and he was afraid of it for a moment.\\nBut there was not much of it.\\n\\nHe spat into the ocean and said, \"Eat that, _Galanos_.  And make a\\ndream you\\'ve killed a man.\"\\n\\nHe knew he was beaten now finally and without remedy and he went back\\nto the stern and found the jagged end of the tiller would fit in the\\nslot of the rudder well enough for him to steer.  He settled the sack\\naround his shoulders and put the skiff on her course.  He sailed\\nlightly now and he had no thoughts nor any feelings of any kind.  He\\nwas past everything now and he sailed the skiff to make his home port\\nas well and as intelligently as he could.  In the night sharks hit the\\ncarcass as someone might pick up crumbs from the table.  The old man\\npaid no attention to them and did not pay any attention to anything\\nexcept steering.  He only noticed how lightly and how well the skiff\\nsailed now there was no great weight beside her.\\n\\nShe\\'s good, he thought.  She is sound and not harmed in any way except\\nfor the tiller.  That is easily replaced.\\n\\nHe could feel he was inside the current now and he could see the lights\\nof the beach colonies along the shore.  He knew where he was now and it\\nwas nothing to get home.\\n\\nThe wind is our friend, anyway, he thought.  Then he added, sometimes.\\nAnd the great sea with our friends and our enemies.  And bed, he\\nthought.  Bed is my friend.  Just bed, he thought.  Bed will be a great\\nthing.  It is easy when you are beaten, he thought.  I never knew how\\neasy it was.  And what beat you, he thought.\\n\\n\"Nothing,\" he said aloud.  \"I went out too far.\"\\n\\nWhen he sailed into the little harbour the lights of the Terrace were\\nout and he knew everyone was in bed.  The breeze had risen steadily and\\nwas blowing strongly now.  It was quiet in the harbour though and he\\nsailed up onto the little patch of shingle below the rocks.  There was\\nno one to help him so he pulled the boat up as far as he could.  Then\\nhe stepped out and made her fast to a rock.\\n\\nHe unstepped the mast and furled the sail and tied it.  Then he\\nshouldered the mast and started to climb.  It was then he knew the\\ndepth of his tiredness.  He stopped for a moment and looked back and\\nsaw in the reflection from the street light the great tail of the fish\\nstanding up well behind the skiff\\'s stern.  He saw the white naked line\\nof his backbone and the dark mass of the head with the projecting bill\\nand all the nakedness between.\\n\\nHe started to climb again and at the top he fell and lay for some time\\nwith the mast across his shoulder.  He tried to get up.  But it was too\\ndifficult and he sat there with the mast on his shoulder and looked at\\nthe road.  A cat passed on the far side going about its business and\\nthe old man watched it.  Then he just watched the road.\\n\\nFinally he put the mast down and stood up.  He picked the mast up and\\nput it on his shoulder and started up the road.  He had to sit down\\nfive times before he reached his shack.\\n\\nInside the shack he leaned the mast against the wall.  In the dark he\\nfound a water bottle and took a drink.  Then he lay down on the bed.\\nHe pulled the blanket over his shoulders and then over his back and\\nlegs and he slept face down on the newspapers with his arms out\\nstraight and the palms of his hands up.\\n\\nHe was asleep when the boy looked in the door in the morning.  It was\\nblowing so hard that the drifting-boats would not be going out and the\\nboy had slept late and then come to the old man\\'s shack as he had come\\neach morning.  The boy saw that the old man was breathing and then he\\nsaw the old man\\'s hands and he started to cry.  He went out very\\nquietly to go to bring some coffee and all the way down the road he was\\ncrying.\\n\\nMany fishermen were around the skiff looking at what was lashed beside\\nit and one was in the water, his trousers rolled up, measuring the\\nskeleton with a length of line.\\n\\nThe boy did not go down.  He had been there before and one of the\\nfishermen was looking after the skiff for him.\\n\\n\"How is he?\" one of the fishermen shouted.\\n\\n\"Sleeping,\" the boy called.  He did not care that they saw him crying.\\n\"Let no one disturb him.\"\\n\\n\"He was eighteen feet from nose to tail,\" the fisherman who was\\nmeasuring him called.\\n\\n\"I believe it,\" the boy said.\\n\\nHe went into the Terrace and asked for a can of coffee.\\n\\n\"Hot and with plenty of milk and sugar in it.\"\\n\\n\"Anything more?\"\\n\\n\"No.  Afterwards I will see what he can eat.\"\\n\\n\"What a fish it was,\" the proprietor said.  \"There has never been such\\na fish.  Those were two fine fish you took yesterday too.\"\\n\\n\"Damn my fish,\" the boy said and he started to cry again.\\n\\n\"Do you want a drink of any kind?\" the proprietor asked.\\n\\n\"No,\" the boy said.  \"Tell them not to bother Santiago.  I\\'ll be back.\"\\n\\n\"Tell him how sorry I am.\"\\n\\n\"Thanks,\" the boy said.\\n\\nThe boy carried the hot can of coffee up to the old man\\'s shack and sat\\nby him until he woke.  Once it looked as though he were waking.  But he\\nhad gone back into heavy sleep and the boy had gone across the road to\\nborrow some wood to heat the coffee.\\n\\nFinally the old man woke.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t sit up,\" the boy said.  \"Drink this.\"  He poured some of the\\ncoffee in a glass.\\n\\nThe old man took it and drank it.\\n\\n\"They beat me, Manolin,\" he said.  \"They truly beat me.\"\\n\\n\"He didn\\'t beat you.  Not the fish.\"\\n\\n\"No.  Truly.  It was afterwards.\"\\n\\n\"Pedrico is looking after the skiff and the gear.  What do you want\\ndone with the head?\"\\n\\n\"Let Pedrico chop it up to use in fish traps.\"\\n\\n\"And the spear?\"\\n\\n\"You keep it if you want it.\"\\n\\n\"I want it,\" the boy said.  \"Now we must make our plans about the other\\nthings.\"\\n\\n\"Did they search for me?\"\\n\\n\"Of course.  With coast guard and with planes.\"\\n\\n\"The ocean is very big and a skiff is small and hard to see,\" the old\\nman said.  He noticed how pleasant it was to have someone to talk to\\ninstead of speaking only to himself and to the sea.  \"I missed you,\" he\\nsaid.  \"What did you catch?\"\\n\\n\"One the first day.  One the second and two the third.\"\\n\\n\"Very good.\"\\n\\n\"Now we fish together again.\"\\n\\n\"No.  I am not lucky.  I am not lucky anymore.\"\\n\\n\"The hell with luck,\" the boy said.  \"I\\'ll bring the luck with me.\"\\n\\n\"What will your family say?\"\\n\\n\"I do not care.  I caught two yesterday.  But we will fish together now\\nfor I still have much to learn.\"\\n\\n\"We must get a good killing lance and always have it on board.  You can\\nmake the blade from a spring leaf from an old Ford.  We can grind it in\\nGuanabacoa.  It should be sharp and not tempered so it will break.  My\\nknife broke.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll get another knife and have the spring ground.  How many days of\\nheavy _brisa_ have we?\"\\n\\n\"Maybe three.  Maybe more.\"\\n\\n\"I will have everything in order,\" the boy said.  \"You get your hands\\nwell old man.\"\\n\\n\"I know how to care for them.

       "'Inflation will limit UK consumers’ spending power, with energy costs a particular problem Britain’s economy is at growing risk of falling into a summer recession amid the biggest squeeze on household incomes since the mid 1950s, as soaring inflation curtails consumer spending power, forecasters have said. Economists said the double blow from slowing post-lockdown growth and rising living costs after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could result in a fall in gross domestic product (GDP) for two consecutive quarters, which is the definition of a recession. After a weaker-than-expected growth performance in February, and with the inflation rate reaching the highest levels since 1992 last month, City forecasters said UK GDP was now on track to grow by about 1% in the first quarter of 2022 before slipping into reverse this summer. Analysts said activity would be reduced by an extra bank holiday for the Queen’s platinum jubilee in July, as public holidays usually lead to a drop in overall economic output. The return to lower rates of activity in the health sector after a winter rush to vaccinate people against Covid-19, as well as households reining in their spending amid the soaring cost of living, are also expected to weigh on growth. James Smith, an economist at the Dutch bank ING, said the economy was likely to shrink in the second quarter. The bank forecasts a 0.3% contraction in the three months to the end of June, followed by growth of just 0.2% in the third quarter. “It’ll be pretty close to a technical recession. Even if one is avoided then we’ll still only see fairly unexciting growth numbers,” Smith said. “If people are spending more money on energy you’d expect some of the non-essentials to fall in sales volumes. That’s what we’ll be watching,” he added. Figures from the Office for National Statistics due on Friday this week are expected to show a fall in retail sales in March as households tighten their belts. It comes as retail industry bosses warn of a slowdown in sales amid the rising cost of living. Neil Shearing, the group chief economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said household disposable income was set to fall by about 1.9% this year. This is bigger than the 1.8% drop in real incomes experienced in 1977, and the biggest since modern records began in the 1950s. “By comparison, real incomes fell by ‘only’ 1.5% in 2011 following the global financial crisis,” he said. “With the economy already close to flatlining, it clearly would not take much to produce a month or two of falling output.” The warnings come after the head of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, said global growth would slow this year and next as the shockwaves from Covid and the war in Ukraine keep inflation higher for longer than first expected. The strength of Britain’s economy will to some extent depend on households who saved during the pandemic continuing to spend. However, while close to £250bn was accumulated during lockdown, most of this was concentrated among wealthier families able to keep working from home, meaning those at most risk from the surging cost of living will feel the biggest pinch. Thomas Pugh, an economist at the accountancy firm RSM UK, said he expected households would probably need to dip into savings or take on debt to protect themselves from rising inflation. “This is a key reason why we think the UK will avoid a recession this year. However, our forecasts suggest GDP growth will average just 0.1% in each of the remaining three quarters of this year – so it would not take much of a rise in oil prices or a disruption in supply chains to push the UK into recession,” he said.'"

       "\"Sanayi ve Teknoloji Bakanı Mustafa Varank, Yozgat programı dahilinde Organize Sanayi Bölgesinde elektronik alanında üretim yapacak bir fabrikanın açılış törenine katıldı. Burada konuşan Varank, Bakanlığı tarafından Yozgat’a yapılan yatırımlara değindi. YOZGAT’TAKİ OSB’LERE 11 MİLYONLUK KAYNAK Varank konuşmasında Bozok OSB ve Fuat Oktay OSB’ye 2022 yatırım programında 11 milyon lira ödenek ayırdıklarını belirterek, “İlimizin OSB sayısı son 19 yıldaki yatırımlarımızla 4’e çıktı. Bugün üretime geçen 49 parsellerde 3 binin üzerinde istihdam sağlanıyor. İnşallah tüm parsellerde üretime geçilmesiyle bu sayı yaklaşık 9 bine ulaşacak. Sanayi ve Teknoloji Bakanlığı olarak üretim ve istihdamın dinamosu olan OSB’lerimize her türlü desteği sağlıyoruz. Örneğin Yozgat’ın heyecanla beklediği Bozok OSB ve Fuat Oktay OSB’ye 2022 yatırım programında 11 milyon lira ödenek ayırdık. Bozok OSB’de altyapı yatırımları tamamlandı. Başvurular alındı. Tahsisler yapılmaya başlandı. Yine Fuat Oktay OSB’de de arazi tahsislerine başlandı. Artık bundan sonrası iş insanlarımızın, yatırımcılarımızın omuzunda. İç Anadolu’nun yükselen yıldızı Yozgat’taki bu OSB’lerde fabrikaların hızlıca yükseleceğinden hiç şüphemiz yok” dedi. 16 MİLYONLUK YATIRIM, 88 KİŞİ İSTİHDAM EDİLECEK  Açılışı yapılan fabrikanın gerçekleştireceği üretimle cari dengeye katkı sağlanacağını kaydeden Varank, “16 milyon liralık yatırım ile kurulan bu fabrika bugün 80 kişiye istihdam sağlıyor. Bu yenilikçi fabrikamız sayesinde Sinyalizasyon Sistemleri, Elektromekanik Sistemleri, Akıllı Trafik Sistemleri, Yolcu Bilgilendirme Sistemleri ve Tıbbi Cihaz gibi yüksek teknolojili ürünlerin üretimi Yozgat’ta yapılıyor. Firma kurulduğundan beri demir yolu sinyalizasyon ekipmanları üreterek şu ana kadar yaklaşık 160 milyon avroluk bir ithalatın önüne geçmiş oldu. Öncelikli olarak ithalatın önünü kesmeye çalışan firma inşallah yakın zamanda ihracata da başlayacak. Böylelikle cari dengeye sağladığı katkılar tırmanışa geçecek” dedi. “TEKNOLOJİK BAĞIMSIZLIK OLMADAN TAM BAĞIMSIZLIK OLMAZ” Bakan Varan teknolojik bağımsızlık olmadan tam bağımsızlığında sağlanamayacağına vurgu yaparak şunları kaydetti: “Ancak bilhassa orta yüksek ve yüksek teknolojili alanlara yatırım noktasında maalesef hala istenilen seviyede değiliz. Tekstilin, gıdanın, tarımın tabi ki başımızın üstünde yeri var. Ancak bunların yanına yüksek katma değerli alanları daha fazla koymamız gerekiyor.

       "'Inflation will limit UK consumers’ spending power, with energy costs a particular problem Britain’s economy is at growing risk of falling into a summer recession amid the biggest squeeze on household incomes since the mid 1950s, as soaring inflation curtails consumer spending power, forecasters have said. Economists said the double blow from slowing post-lockdown growth and rising living costs after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could result in a fall in gross domestic product (GDP) for two consecutive quarters, which is the definition of a recession. After a weaker-than-expected growth performance in February, and with the inflation rate reaching the highest levels since 1992 last month, City forecasters said UK GDP was now on track to grow by about 1% in the first quarter of 2022 before slipping into reverse this summer. Analysts said activity would be reduced by an extra bank holiday for the Queen’s platinum jubilee in July, as public holidays usually lead to a drop in overall economic output. The return to lower rates of activity in the health sector after a winter rush to vaccinate people against Covid-19, as well as households reining in their spending amid the soaring cost of living, are also expected to weigh on growth. James Smith, an economist at the Dutch bank ING, said the economy was likely to shrink in the second quarter. The bank forecasts a 0.3% contraction in the three months to the end of June, followed by growth of just 0.2% in the third quarter. “It’ll be pretty close to a technical recession. Even if one is avoided then we’ll still only see fairly unexciting growth numbers,” Smith said. “If people are spending more money on energy you’d expect some of the non-essentials to fall in sales volumes. That’s what we’ll be watching,” he added. Figures from the Office for National Statistics due on Friday this week are expected to show a fall in retail sales in March as households tighten their belts. It comes as retail industry bosses warn of a slowdown in sales amid the rising cost of living. Neil Shearing, the group chief economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said household disposable income was set to fall by about 1.9% this year. This is bigger than the 1.8% drop in real incomes experienced in 1977, and the biggest since modern records began in the 1950s. “By comparison, real incomes fell by ‘only’ 1.5% in 2011 following the global financial crisis,” he said. “With the economy already close to flatlining, it clearly would not take much to produce a month or two of falling output.” The warnings come after the head of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, said global growth would slow this year and next as the shockwaves from Covid and the war in Ukraine keep inflation higher for longer than first expected. The strength of Britain’s economy will to some extent depend on households who saved during the pandemic continuing to spend. However, while close to £250bn was accumulated during lockdown, most of this was concentrated among wealthier families able to keep working from home, meaning those at most risk from the surging cost of living will feel the biggest pinch. Thomas Pugh, an economist at the accountancy firm RSM UK, said he expected households would probably need to dip into savings or take on debt to protect themselves from rising inflation. “This is a key reason why we think the UK will avoid a recession this year. However, our forecasts suggest GDP growth will average just 0.1% in each of the remaining three quarters of this year – so it would not take much of a rise in oil prices or a disruption in supply chains to push the UK into recession,” he said.'"
