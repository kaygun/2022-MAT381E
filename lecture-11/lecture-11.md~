# What is a graph

## A Mathematician's Definition

A graph consists of two sets:

- A set of vertices (nodes)
- A set of edges (connections)

## A Mathematician's Definition

$$ V = \{ A, B, C, D, E \}$$

$$ E = \{ (A,B), (A,C), (B,D), (C,D), (D,E) $$ 

## An Intuitive Definition

A graph consists of nodes and connections:

~~~~ {.dot }
graph {
  node[shape=circle];
  A -- { B C } -- D -- E;
}
~~~~

$$ V = \{ A, B, C, D, E \}$$

$$ E = \{ (A,B), (A,C), (B,D), (C,D), (D,E) $$ 

## Types of Graphs

- Undirected
- Directed
- Weighted

## Undirected Graphs

The edges in an undirected graph have no direction:

## Directed Graphs

The edges in a directed graph have direction:

~~~~ {.dot }
digraph {
  node[shape=circle];
  A -> {B C} -> D -> E -> A;
  B -> A;
}
~~~~

## Weighted Graphs

The edges in a weighted graph have weights:

~~~~ {.dot }
graph {
  node[shape=circle];
  A -- B [label=1];
  A -- C [label=2];
  B -- D [label=1];
  C -- D [label=-1];
  D -- E [label=0];
}
~~~~

# Graphs and Data

## What type of data can be represented by graphs?

Any data where we can relate two data points

- Text data
- Route information for transportation data
- Internet itself
- Friendship graphs in social networks

## Text data

- Text consists of sentences and words
- Sentences are related by words
- Words are related by sentences

## Route information for transportation

Remember HW2?

# Tools for Graph Data

## Graph Language

[GraphViz](https://graphviz.org/) is an excellent graph definition language and visualization framework.

## Graphviz Example

```
graph {
  A -- { B C } -- { D E } -- E;
}
```

## Python and Graphs

The three main graph toolkits are
- [igraph](https://igraph.org/) 
- [graph-tool](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/static/doc/index.html)
- [networkx](https://networkx.org/)
